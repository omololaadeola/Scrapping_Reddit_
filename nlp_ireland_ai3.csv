When I saw those temperatures I thought of Korey Stringer.

Obviously visiting teams can do some things to protect their players, bringing their own shade and fans, but playing high intensity sports in the heat without a place to cooldown is dangerous; then again, full contact sports are inherently dangerous for other reasons too.

I guess some northern teams could do the opposite in the winter with not heating opponents sideline area, but you can always put on more layers and playing football will warm your core temperature. There is a limit to how many layers you can remove.",NerdyDjinn,2022-10-17,Ireland

Literally every outdoor stadium is like this. The stadium is symmetrical its not like they covered the home side and not the visitor side. Unfortunately sun doesn't stay directly overhead. Bucs stadium same thing happens.  The field runs north south and the home bench is on the west side. Visitor side is staring into the sun entire game while home side gets shade as the sun goes down.

So everything I’m saying is contingent on this picture being an accurate representation of the situation, which I frankly concede might not be pending more robust evidence. We should all welcome some long term data collection on this issue. 

That said, as understandable as it is that Miami fans want to defend their team, the ones who have been defending this whiffed badly on this issue. This is not an argument about “home field advantage” and is not comparable with cold weather cities and their conditions. Snow and freezing rain is inconvenient. Heat kills football players every year in this country. Those are two separate issues. IF road team players in Miami are routinely being made to spend the whole game in 120 degree heat, that is a massive health and safety issue. Heat stress like that not only causes acute death but can create long term damage in the body. So even if the chance of a top tier athlete dying in these conditions is very low, there are still serious long term consequences they could be exposed to. The same way players are unlikely to die on the field from head trauma but are still exposed to long term health consequences.

All that said, if any team is made to play in a stadium with climate control options, it should start with extreme heat cities. Phoenix’s stadium (or whatever suburb I’m going to be pedantically told it’s actually in) is a great road map. Let’s fix that health and safety issue first and then return to complaining about the inconvenience issue of wind in Chicago or snow in Buffalo.",stripes361,2022-10-16,Ireland

Approaching women is the easy part, the hard part is the conversation and building up attraction. That comes with time and practice.

Recognize she's not the only girl in the world you need to concern yourself with. That said keep in mind you need to pay attention to how well she treats you, if she's selfish, and what kind of value or benefit she brings to your life.

I'd also add two corrections to your original post:

1. You say that most British people will go their whole lives without ever watching or playing a game of rugby or cricket. In high schools we have compulsory PE every week for 5 years, and they're required to teach you a variety of sports. We would spend half a term playing different sports, so in my school we ended up playing (as girls): football, field hockey, netball, basketball, touch rugby, swimming, softball, cricket, rounders, tennis, gymnastics, dance, athletics, dodgeball, circuit training, yoga and a few other made up games over the course of school. 

2. School sports at any level are not the same as in the US and are just a hobby, so if you're sporty you'll often end up playing more than one sport, just for the whole year. For example, I played touch rugby, netball and swam at school. At university I didn't play sports, but I had a friend who played both field hockey and cricket.",nadhbhs,2021-04-12,Ireland

Of course there are changes in the seasons, but a lot of Europe doesn’t see anything too extreme. It might be cold, there might even be a bit of snow, but nothing that can’t be managed. If there is particularly bad weather, it’s usually not for long -a matter of days in most cases, so if games are postponed it’s usually only a few games and it’s not too difficult to reschedule them. Football is a very flexible sport that can be played in all sorts of conditions and climates. It’s not like Cricket, which can’t be played in rainy conditions. Football is also a sport that’s designed to be played throughout the majority of the year. Ever since it became an organised sport in England, it’s been played from late summer right through the autumn and winter  up to late spring. The nature of the competitions, particularly the leagues require a long season in order to work. As it spread throughout the world, some places have varied the times of their Football season to suit, and of course the major international tournaments are played in the summer, during the close season.

Personally, I look at American sports and I think their seasons are too short. It’s almost like a season is determined on form.

One of the interesting things about the Football season is seeing how a team’s form dips and pick ups. You can have a team that starts off on fire and then drops away, and it’s interesting to see if they can regain some form or if they’ll continue to drop. Another team might start off terribly and be in real trouble, but then they hit a bit of form and pick up, will it be enough to lift them up to where they need to be, or is it too little too late?

I don’t see that in American sports, or certainly not to the same degree anyway. And if a team does have a bad season, they get to go again in the SAME completion - no relegation! AND they get first pick of the best new players! 

Football has way more twists and turns and is much more intense. Therefore it requires a longer season.",TomL79,2021-04-12,Ireland

Those three are usually played in schools, soccer both inside and outside, but volleyball and basketball only inside (at least in my experience, I never saw someone playing volleyball outside, and it's been ages since I last saw someone playing basketball outside).

Other than that team sports in Poland are pretty much non-existent. There might be some hockey but I never heard of it, even ice-skating is that popular as in other countries, so what are we even talking about. There definitely isn't American football (I've never seen any American football field in Poland) or baseball (again, no baseball field in Poland as far as I know), because people here don't care about them.

Since we expanded the playoff (which I’m generally against, but it’s over now so no point in fighting it), I like the idea of the expanded playoff games taking place earlier in December and thru early January.  Then, moving all the bowl games to the following year as Week0 or week1 games during Labor Day weekend as the “kickoff” for the college football season.

Sure, neutral site games blow compared to on-campus, however, if we keep the bowls in tact, we will be able to build up hype to that game all offseason.  Wisconsin vs Oklahoma State is no longer a *“well, both QBs portaled so who knows how it will play out with 3 weeks of practice,”*  it will become THE game to start the season with months of hype built up for it.  It will be the debut of a new coach (Fickell) against an established successful program.  

Also, during Labor Day weekend there is still no NFL yet.  The long weekend also still allows for fan travel to the neutral site games.  It would be a VERY condensed schedule, but it would be glorious if we get GOOD matchups to start the season every year, and games everyday starting on Thursday, and playing until Monday.  

This would take several years to develop, but I love this scenario because it keeps bowl games in tact, and returns actual meaning to them.  Questions still left to be answered:

*What about the teams who aren’t bowl eligible from the year before?

* Move the entire regular season up one week, start it in Week 0. Thanksgiving weekend becomes Conference Championship weekend. Move Army/Navy up a week as well. 

* Then into December, schedule out the playoff so that the Semi-Finals land on New Years Day. Have the Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl be permanent Semi-Final sites in their traditional time slots. 

* The Orange, Fiesta, Cotton, and Peach bowls enter into a rotation to host quarter final games on alternating years along with other bowl sites bidding into a longer rotation (one year might be Orange, Fiesta, Sun, Outback, next year Cotton, Peach, Gator, Holiday, whatever). This means that 2 of the NY6 in any given year aren't hosting playoff games and are instead hosting the biggest non-playoff match-ups and doing so during their traditional New Years timeslots on those years. 

* Teams eliminated in the play-in round of the playoff (the on campus games) are also eligible to go to a bowl site game later in December. The two NY6 bowls that aren't hosting the playoff games that year would each invite 1 playoff eliminated team and 1 next-team-out that didn't make the playoff. 

* Only teams with 7 wins or more should be eligible to play in a bowl game, with 6-6 teams being called up only when needed to fill bowls. This naturally means less bowl games can be filled, I figure about 10 less bowls. If the 10 lowest tier bowls were eliminated, it would probably raise the prestige and viewership of the remaining bowls, and maintain the slight ""prestige"" associated with bowl eligibility. Rather than 82 of the ~130 FBS teams going bowling, it would be 62, which is roughly half.

* With the season ending earlier, the bowls can be more spread throughout December to maximize best time slots.

* Bowls shouldn't all be on ESPN and should get other networks involved in bidding, especially with a 1 week longer bowl season and less bowls total to bid over. 

* Instead of 1 to 1 Conference Tie-Ins, more bowls should incorporate a multi-conference Tie-in, like how the Orange bowl pits the ACC champ against the best available option of the SEC/B1G/Notre Dame. Put all of the bowls in a pecking order of prestige, have each of them tied to at least 4 conferences, and then give them that added flexibility as they go down the draft list to pick interesting match-ups between several conference choices",pandajedi,2022-12-28,Ireland

Remaining teams are bound by conference for matchup, and it isn't first pick by the Bowl, but first place of the remaining team. Orange Bowl shouldnt pick Clemson because it is a bigger brand than say, WF, but should take Clemson because they got first place in their conference after missing the playoffs (as an example).  If you want to eliminate tie-ins by conference, then make them rotating tie-ins instead so you still get a healthy mix.  I.e. Orange Bowl is SEC-ACC for three years, then ACC-B10, then B10-B12, etc etc. 5 conference, 6 years each, you'll get marquee matchups. 

Too many bowls as is. Cut at least 6 and make 7-5 the standard, 6-6 the exception. Not everyone gets a trophy.

CFP/NY6: 1st Round and Quarterfinal games played on campus of higher seeded teams. Semifinals at Rotating NY6 sites (Rose/Sugar, Cotton/Orange, Fiesta/Peach) with highest remaining seed receiving geographic advantage.

Non-Semifinal NY6 games are filled by the 8 teams that don’t advance to the semifinals, with respect to historical tie-ins, geography, etc. as best as possible

Tier 2 Bowls (Alamo, Citrus, Gator, Holiday, Liberty, Sun): Runner-up of G5 conference(s) represented in CFP, G5 conference champions, Independent with best record (or 2nd best dependent on CFP selection), next best remaining team in each P5 conference based on rank/record/conference placements.

Tier 3 Bowls (Cheez-It, Duke's Mayo, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Music City, Pinstripe, ReliaQuest, Texas): 2 teams from each P5 conference, 1 team each from G5 conferences; 1 independent or remaining slot filled at discretion of the bowl if not enough bowl-eligible independents.

Tier 4 Bowls (Remaining Bowl Games): FBS teams must meet 7 wins and not serving NCAA penalty for bowl eligibility regardless of conference. Teams from the FCS level can send at least 1 team per conference not selected for the FCS playoff or Celebration Bowl as long as they meet the 7-win threshold as well. Since Ivy League and Pioneer League are non-scholarship, it is up to their discretion to send teams from their leagues to bowl games. If more bowl slots than teams available for those selections, then remaining slots filled by 6-win teams based on their APR standings. (For this to really work, the FCS playoffs would revert back to 16-team format)",ThompsonCreekTiger,2022-12-28,Ireland

However, understand this. In America the high level players do play year round. From 10-18 I never took more than a week off. In southern California we played in 2 state leagues, 2 regional leagues, a national league, and a state tournament every year. Give or take a league and add some tournaments.

Plus high school teams. And I did ODP about 8 weeks a year. Then add in college scouting things and other teams like agency based select teams meant for playing abroad. 

So sometimes these things would actually overlap. So the season never ended. 

The problem is that not enough teams have that schedule, maybe 40-50 in the whole country. It’s why we don’t produce many high level players in profesisonal leagues. Christian pulisic is someone who is a good example that went from  ODP, to the academy league, to overseas in the bundesliga.

Even at PyeongChang, he came back from 17th after a cracked-under-pressure short program to fifth (!) place place overall because his free skate was so much stronger than the rest of the competition (and earned him the highest Olympic technical and total score since the new point system was implemented). He now has the longest current win streak among active skaters and remains undefeated since the 2018 Olympics.

Regarding the Diarra case the linked article didn't mention the issue of time-limited contract. In my view (not a lawyer though), if a player is able to terminate a contract unilaterally ahead of time, so should the employer.

From trying to break FFP (Galatasaray vs UEFA, Striani vs UEFA & Union Belge), to prevent the TPO ban (Seraing vs FIFA), to remove CAS, to the Superleague (whether in the current form or the Charleroi case in the G14 era two decades ago). It's very clear through many of his interviews that deregulating seems to be a core idea he believes in.

But all those cases show one thing imo, it's that the EU will have to clearly legislate on the matter, the White paper on sport, the Amsterdam & Nice declarations, the specificity of sport in the Treaty of Lisbon (TFEU 165), this weird mix of soft law, case law, vague descriptions won't suffice any longer.

But a three-judge panel of the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, writing that the fact the policy could be a restraint of trade is enough.

>“Contrary to the district court’s conclusion, there is no need for Relevent to allege a prior ‘agreement to agree’ or conspiracy to adopt the policy; the adoption of the policy, combined with the member leagues’ prior agreement, by joining FIFA, to adhere to its policies, constitutes an agreement on the part of all — whether they voted in favor of the policy or not — to adhere to the announced restriction on competition,” the panel ruled.

Having read the ISU decisions (ECJ + appeal), there wasn’t really anything that surprised me or changed my thinking about the eventual ruling in this case. 

Largely the opinion is a whole lot of “the case law says this needs to be subject to rigorous analysis to ensure that the sanctioning rules are tailored to achieve legitimate objectives without veering into impermissible anticompetitive behaviour”. Which is the tl;dr of the ISU case as well. 

Notable points that I think are interesting are 113-116 (framework for a compliant sanctioning regime) and 120-122 (suggesting that punishing players would not be permissible). 

The first would require UEFA to define rules for sanctioning that complied with prior case law, which would require them to clearly define the requirements under which they would sanction the ESL.  Those requirements must be specifically tailored to legitimate objectives, and they would be required to grant sanctioning if those requirements were met.

The second would prevent UEFA from punishing players for participating in a breakaway league, e.g. by banning them from international play.  This would make a full breakaway model much more plausible if players could freely move between The UEFA pyramid and the breakaway leagues.",a_lumberjack,2023-03-13,Ireland

The season isn’t a year long but 10 months from August to May. It only feels like a year because we’ve now filled that summer break with pre-season tours, European playoffs, international tournaments and hours of transfer speculation. Essentially the determination to squeeze as much money as possible out of the game has led to the off season getting shorter and shorter and clogged with more games. 

Originally football’s season was tied to the cricket season. Cricket teams played in the summer months and wanted another sport to play to stay fit in the winter so founded football clubs (this is how a lot of clubs including Everton, Spurs and Milan were all founded). Rugby by contrast has been always played in the same months as football as they both are descended from the same sport. In the uk if you play in school you will probably finish playing football in spring and start playing cricket and it’s common to do both. 

So why did football come to dominate the other 2 so much? I can’t talk about other European countries but in the UK it’s tied very much into the politics of class. Cricket and Rugby Union (Rugby league is different and very regional centred on the north of England) are both seen as the sport of the elite, while football is for the common working class football. Partly this is simply due to the obvious accessibility differences in the sports - compared to cricket, football is easy to understand and you can play it yourself simply with a ball and mates or even a wall if you just want to practice your skills, with cricket you need a whole load of equipment and facilities. Most importantly however it is due to the practical ways that playing cricket and rugby were kept to the upper class, to play or watch a cricket test you need 3 days - it’s hard to get those off work, similarly until a few decades ago rugby was a strictly amateur work which meant you needed to be independently wealthy to be involved. You can see this still in both sports- the majority of cricket and rugby players are still private school educated and from wealthier upper class backgrounds. Not only was football far more accessible played in city centres you could walk to on weekend days so you could go to the pub after, but because it’s players were also humble from working class backgrounds, the majority of common people felt drawn to football. Class is very important in the uk, and football became a proud way of expressing your pride in being working class and from a working class community - this was rewarded in the stakes of the game where from early on not only was there professionalism but your towns team could play for something serious, promotion, relegation an FA Cup or a league title - rivalry and intensity were expected from the start especially if you played local enemies. In cricket friendliness and sportsmanship were always established as more important than competition - the game still has tea breaks to avoid being too strenuous, and tests and county cricket began as basically friendlies. People found it easy to reject a sport that seemed to be based on elitism and snobbery in the upper classes.",ninjomat,2021-04-11,Ireland

Football isn't played during the summer in most countries, and the season ends in May and begins in late August. A lot of people continue to play during summer because the nice weather means they can, but most official leagues are off. In England, cricket is traditionally the summer sport, with a season starting in April and ending in September (as you can't play cricket in the rain)

I know I’m late to the party here, but since you asked about other people with health conditions and prioritizing being responsible vs. enjoying your life while your body allows, thought I’d chime in. I’ve had IBD for 12 years (I’m 24 currently) and this has weighed heavily on my mind as I’ve become financial responsible for myself over the past few years. 

While I haven’t settled on a perfect approach (a doubt I ever will), I’ve noticed that I feel best with a clear system, rather than “well, I could be completely disabled in ten years so who cares if I buy a $15k couch”. Right now, I have pre-specified percentages that go to different savings buckets and beyond that, I give myself permission to spend money on my wants— specifically leaning into experiences that could be harder for me to enjoy in the future. I do still track all of my monthly expenses, which helps me feel in control of my spending in case I ever need to cut back (due to disability, job loss, etc.).

Thank you for talking about creating a healthcare PoA with M. That is such a tough conversation to have with people you love but is so important. I did this a few years ago and it was not easy.

Yes, football's the most popular sport in Europe, due to being the most longevous team sport in the continent (ever heard of mob football?), as well as its formal organization in England. However, it's not the only team sport either rooted or popular in Europe, and there are several school athletic programs dedicated to other sports, regardless of seasonal changes.

The colors also should be consistent, so don’t use the same color to represent baseball/softball and strength. Sticking with each sport being its own color or possibly not having a color scale for the skill chart would be a better play here. 

But I also think the skill headers should be at the top of the bars—it prevents the reader from having to look down at the bottom to see the skill and then go back up to compare sports. Maybe adjust the formatting as well so the headers are not cut off, like my assumption is that the skill is “Hand-Eye Coordination” but it’s a good general rule that your audience knows nothing and cannot assume anything. 

Lastly an interesting thing to play with might be grouping sports after a certain point, so choose a cutoff whether that be top 10 or everything less difficult than Field Hockey since it’s the last one before you have to scroll, and everything after that point is grouped as “other”, then you can create a hierarchy with the option to expand the other category if your audience wanted to see more.",wreckingballofstress,2022-11-16,Ireland

Sports Degree AND Gym OR Swimming OR GAA OR Rugby OR Soccer OR Football,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColumbineKillers/comments/11klgn9/fatal_friendship_rocky_mountain_news_august_1999/,"Fatal Friendship - Rocky Mountain News, August 1999 (Some early misinformation, but overall pretty decent. Long read, article continued in comments.)","**Girls and guns**  
They may have shared a hatred, but Eric and Dylan parted ways on a crucial part of high school life: girls.  
Dylan rarely dated.  
""He liked girls, you know, but he would never approach them because he was too shy or was waiting for them to approach him,"" said Sarah Slater, his friend from theater.  
Nate Dykeman has another opinion on why Dylan didn't date.  
""Dylan wanted to wait,"" he said. ""He didn't want to get into anything in high school.""  
Robyn Anderson had a crush on Dylan and they went out a couple of times, but Dylan never considered her a girlfriend.  
Pals since ninth grade, both studied German. Both were a bit nervous around the opposite sex. But Dylan was always polite. He treated her with respect.  
Eric asked a number of girls out, including a girl both he and Nate liked. The girl chose Nate, which made Eric so mad he didn't talk to his friend for a while.  
Many girls told Eric no.  
Brenda Parker said yes.  
They had met at Southwest Plaza in late January 1998, his junior year, when Brenda and her girlfriends were certain a group of guys was following them.  
""Dylan was really tall so you can't miss him,"" Brenda said.  
She confronted the boys. They ended up talking about what they were going to do that night. Cruising in her 1996 Mustang, Brenda said.  
That night Eric drove to Westminster, where Brenda lived.  
Brenda would turn 23 in three weeks. Eric was 16.  
Only she didn't know that.  
When he talked about school, she didn't know he meant Columbine. She thought he meant a community college.  
""He acted a lot older,"" she said. ""And I'm immature.""  
They bowled. They cruised. They went to Bandimere Speedway.  
She thought he was nice. He bought her Mountain Dews -- ""I didn't even have to ask."" And he told her she was pretty.  
Eric taught Brenda how to download Doom and other computer games, and how to use the Internet.  
Eric liked to visit her Westminster apartment because she lived alone. Sometimes Dylan came along, but he rarely said a word. One night Dylan made Brenda laugh when he slipped out of his shell and lip synched to a Beastie Boys song on television.  
Brenda visited Littleton a couple of times. She watched as Eric and Dylan shot crickets with a BB-gun in Eric's basement.  
Once Eric called her late and whispered for her to come get him, that he was going to sneak out of the house. Then they drove to Dylan's house and waited for him. About an hour later, Dylan's tall figure appeared out of the dark.  
The trio drove to the mountains and drank. They decided to spend the night in her Mustang because they were worried about drinking and driving.  
""Eric was a little tipsy and we went for a walk and it was really dark. He was holding on to me and he tripped and he took me with him,"" Brenda said.  
She described their brief relationship as a ""friendship but more than a friendship."" One of the reasons it ended was because Eric was grounded and couldn't get away to see her much.  
Brenda thinks the last time she saw Eric was about five months before the shootings. They met at the Macaroni Grill in Westminster.  
""He seemed like he was really bummed out. At first I thought it was because we were broken up. He kept calling and wanting to see me but I didn't want to because I had a boyfriend at the time,"" she said. ""He just said he was bummed out. I asked about what and he wouldn't tell.""  
What Brenda didn't know is that Eric and Dylan had been shopping for guns with Robyn.  
In December, they picked up three guns -- a Hi Point 9mm carbine rifle and two shotguns -- at a gun show.  
A Gilpin County man named J.D. ""Jimmie"" Tanner has them monthly at the Denver Merchandise Mart on East 58th Avenue.  
Robyn already had turned 18, and Dylan and Eric apparently thought they needed her along. Actually, at 17, either of them could have bought the guns from an unlicensed dealer at the Tanner show.  
Robyn has said she figured Dylan and Eric wanted the guns for hunting, or maybe they were collectors. She wasn't sure. To her, these were just cool guys she had fun with.  
They gave her cash. She showed the seller her driver's license. They got their guns.  
About a month later, Eric and Dylan went to another Tanner show. They met up with one of their Blackjack buddies, Philip Duran, and his friend, Mark Manes.  
Philip knew Eric and Dylan were scouting another gun. He put them in touch with Mark, who owned a TEC-DC9 semiautomatic pistol. The foursome discussed the sale at the January gun show, and Dylan and Eric later paid Mark $500 for the gun, according to court records.  
In early 1999, Brenda came home to find three messages from Eric on her answering machine. He kept calling back because her machine cut him off.  
""He said, 'I'm sorry I lied to you. There's something we need to talk about. I'm 17. I'll be 18 in three months.""'  
And then he told her it would be great if she wanted more in their relationship.  
But it was something else he said that prompted Brenda to call right away.  
He had left some Rammstein CDs at her house. He told her she could have them because he wouldn't be needing them anymore.  
She wanted to see if he was all right. And she also wanted to make sure he was clear about their relationship.  
""I told him I just wanted to be friends.""

Borg winning three Channel Slams, Connors and Wilander winning slams on all three surfaces, Stich reaching slam finals on all three surfaces etc is that bit more significant than it would be today.",AngloAlbanian999,2023-04-08,Ireland

Since you have two college degrees, you don't need your high school diploma. I'd remove the dates as well; when you graduated isn't relevant.

Listing your skills is fine. Rating yourself is useless. Chances are high an employer who is rating you will not agree with your ratings.

Along those lines, listing ""soft"" skills such as Customer Service isn't recommended because they can't be evaluated in an interview.

What computer skills do you have? List those. Employers usually want to know if you have experience with things like Word and Excel.

For your employment, it's helpful to quantify your duties where possible. In most cases, hiring managers can make educated guesses about what you do from the title. What they want to know is how good you are at doing it.

Your profile needs to be completely redone. For starters, you have a huge grammatical flaw. It reads like you have several years of experience seeking employment, and doesn't get better from there. I'd suggest going to Google and searching on ""employment profiles for college graduates"" for some examples.

Seriously, if the redditor charged you, insist on a refund.

EDIT: one more thing: drop the Hobbies section. Employers don't care unless they're related to the job.",mysteresc,2023-03-10,Ireland

Keep it simple. When hiring, for me, resumes are a simple demonstration on how concisely a candidate can demonstrate value. Brevity is wit. Just use a basic word doc, keep it neat, and highlight your biggest accomplishments - but keep it objective by using metrics. Fluff copy is irritating and unnecessary. 

Also, make sure your LinkedIn is up to date. I’ll infer more from a LinkedIn profile than I do a resume.

Think of it this way: 

LinkedIn = comprehensive history and basic fit
Resume = most important highlights
Interview = demonstration of personality/culture fit",OQOQOQOQOQOQOQ,2023-03-10,Ireland

Name and contact info should be at the very top (unless it's just edited for Reddit)  The ""Profile bubble"" looks awkward with the white space on the left.  

If you're applying to anything that values the language skills or working in bi-lingual areas, move the Languages up higher!

Being more specific would help immensely.  Use dollar values or quantities of assets. 

ex:

* Organized and monitored inventory of doohickys accounting for $33M of annual revenue for your mom.
* Processed payment transactions for customers \[something something\] point-of-sale systems

Lead with the ""powerful"" words/action verbs (something like that).  

""Consistently ensures a positive and hassle free customer experience""

The ""positive and hassle free"" isn't really tangible, but actually looks/sounds good IMO.  Particularly with anything customer oriented.  If you need it to fill some space in the work history it's not bad, but might work better in the profile/objective block.

&#x200B;

The Skills section as presented is vague.  What kind of computer skills?  DevOps? Databases?  Networking?  LibreOffice?

Stock Management:  Was it a database, a spreadsheet?  Specific software?

&#x200B;

Marketing, could that move over to the history?  

""Orchestrated a marketing campaign increasing customer turn out by ....."" or ""Orchestrated a marketing campaign to spread awareness of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_""

&#x200B;

Or can you make it more specific towards what you're doing/have done (even in school).

Skills

* Financial Management Analysis
* SQL Database Administration
* Electromagnetics Compliance

I would focus on the strengths. Did you have a decent GPA that you graduated with?  If it’s above 3.0, then list it. List some of the relevant course work for the career field you’re pursuing. 

Your “Skills rating” is useless. Use Skills section for relevant software experience, such as the obligatory MS Office (PowerPoint, excel, word). If you have MS Access and Project skills, that would be worth mentioning.

Admitting to flaws on a resume is a strange thing to do strategically. For example, one of the things that jumps out at me about this resume is that it advertises that your computer skills are 3/5, so 60%? Not something I would like to advertise. :) I completely understand the reasoning that made you think it would be all right (neighbored as it is by so many 5/5s, and of course it would look silly to have all 5/5s) - that is the main reason why people don't usually assign numerical ratings to their skills on resumes.

Another example of the same thing, this resume calls attention to the fact that you may not be completely fluent in English, since it specifies that you are a native speaker of Spanish but not of English; completely unnecessarily. I am a native English speaker and I hereby grant you permission to describe yourself as fluent, or, if you're not comfortable doing that, just list ""Languages: English, Spanish"" and leave it at that.

There is a lot of inter-league play, which results in more games throughout the year. 

Countries, people, & sports are different.  Tennis & MMA are also year-round sports.  This is possible because of the large pool of participants & the fact that they all compete on separate schedules.  But you can't play American football 52 Sundays out of the year - that's just not possible.  Would you be first in line to get tackled each & every week?  No you would not, because you would die. 

Just curious, but is there any reasonable explanation for the need to post this to 14 different subs?  Or is that a european thing too?",NoSweatBetting,2021-04-11,Ireland

Theres a big difference on the schedules because in euro / sa countries theres usually  1 national cup, 1 international cup and the home league playing at same time so its super hard to fit a schedule for this. While americans only play their national league with no other competition

In south America, Argentina changed their schedule before covid to have the same transfer window as Europe so they dont sell players on during an important part of the season and this is what most of leagues aim in SA. I think in Mexico they have the same schedule as Europe",peruvianhope,2021-04-11,Ireland

Soccer is a sport like racing minivans is a sport. It's not the best, biggest, and strongest, and doesn't even require thumbs... or even 4 fully functional limbs to participate.

Baseball is a sport. It requires great eye hand coordination, speed, manual dexterity, strength, strategy, endurance, and bravery. 

To answer your question though: yes baseball is a religion. We have our gods  (Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron, Nolan Ryan), our demons (Pete Rose, the Chicago Black Sox), our prodigal son (Mike Trout), our sinners  (Alex Rodriguez, Barry Bonds, Ty Cobb), our saints (John Smoltz, Cal Ripen jr, Lou Gherig), our Bible (The record books), our Temple (the Hall of Fame), and we even have our missionaries (The world baseball classic). We had our Martin Luther (Jackie Robinson). We even have denominations that only separate by one rule (the designated hitter). We have miracles that happen on occasion (perfect game pitched, immaculate inning, 4 HR in a game). We have sins (hitting a batter, arguing with an umpire, fighting, steroids) and we have prayers (meetings on the mound). We have our holidays (all star break, world series), and we have our Sunday school (spring training). Most importantly though, we have our worship services. At least 162 times a year we come together to worship our sport. We're bigger than a religion. ",brandonrex,2017-07-18,Ireland

Ultimately though academic alliances fairly insignificant in terms of conference realignment and largely are just marketing.

There are thousands of research partnerships, alliances, co-ops, associations, (pick your synonym here) that share data and resources between universities. Most of which do not care on iota with regards to what people are playing shooty hoops or hand egg against each other.

These agreements already cross conferences all the time to achieve whatever any given school, or department within a school needs. Because that is what really matters and where the money really is.

The [Big Ten Academic Alliance benefits are basically just things that exist no matter what.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Academic_Alliance) Top researchers and faculty are always going to network with anyone else respected in the field. Anyone can participate in the Google Books repository. Universities share course requirements and materials all the time to maintain research and accreditation standards.

It is a positive impact that all these B1G schools do this with each other as an additional link between them and their conference members. However they are also doing these same things with hundreds to thousands of other institution all over the world to varying degrees. Which they would continue to do so regardless of athletic conference.

If the AD can put a nice little bow on it that they get some additional academic benefit from jumping conferences then it makes it an easier sell to the President. TV money and marketing is ultimately all that matters for athletics. The more financially independent and profitable the athletic department can be the better. Since then they don't have to drag on or take money away from the research efforts and funding.

You kept talking about this research ""scaffold"" without really explaining what it is (which really is the most important point here) and then used a whole ass analogy of a library with wifi to explain a concept which is probably already well understood. 

This is basically almost every argument anyone on this sub makes regarding these academic alliances. Vague suggestions of benefits and meaningless statistics without descriptions of how it actually fits into the way academia and research works. 

I think there certainly is more prestige to being in the Pac 12, but it is more perception for a crowd that even knows or cares what athletic conferences are. I find it crazy that people are ascribing so much growth in research to fucking athletic conferences. A major problem in academia right now is how grant money is basically consolidating in the hands of very few, whether you look at that by age/sex/race of the grant's principal investigator or by institution or by geography. Academia is a rich get richer enterprise and being a major research school now just means you will continue to be a major research school, which describes Utah's position. It is hard to overcome this unless you live in a particularly wealthy or populous state (Texas schools have grown their academic profile tremendously in the last 20 years).",BonJovicus,2023-03-19,Ireland

Some fields may be different, but in mine most research money comes from individual grants. Larger pools for the department go through the college and university and are used to pay TAs but not research. Almost none of my research colleagues are in the same sports conference as me or each other, those connections are from mutual interests and personal connections. And I couldn’t care less what institution someone is based out of, I care what skills they personally bring to the table.

I have a hard time seeing streaming being a viable majority or standalone option, given it means you have to be searching out a specific school to watch them. I’m not going to watch Kansas vs Iowa State if I have to search for it specifically, but if it happens to be on its better than the news. I think streaming can be a lower value bandage to make up some of the money for not getting the prime time slots, similar to how MAC and others will broadcast on less valuable nights, but it probably isn’t much more advantageous to be in a bundled conference at that point as opposed to an independent given they have to search you out. I don’t care about most football in my conference, I care about how my schools are doing.

 Further, even though sports money is quite small compared to a big school’s endowment, they probably want the athletic department to be able to sustain itself economically so they don’t have to find some other way to fund it since *you can’t pay for sportsball with an NSF grant.* I would think that makes the margins all the more important, though admittedly I’m not familiar with the economics of athletic departments. 

I think it’s most apt to say economics matters and drives conference realignment, and academics are something administrators like to brag about when talking with one another if their sports aren’t doing well enough to brag about. Especially since financially they make so little of a difference to the overall revenue of an institution. 

What role streaming plays in the economics is unknown, especially given media companies are having a bit of an economic whoopsie rn. If I can draw a parallel, you tend to get far more viewers on YouTube than you will on Twitch, but the Twitch viewers are much more dedicated.",Doogitywoogity,2023-03-19,Ireland

If this was changed to ""Academics Are the Reason No Pac-12 Teams *Want* to Join the Big 12"" I'd completely agree. As written, I don't know if it's quite that set in stone, especially if we're looking further down the road.

As of right now, I think the Pac-12 schools will reach an agreement that will keep them together for the next five-ish years. But there is little reason for any school that believes it can eventually get a Big Ten invite to agree to anything that keeps it locked in past the expiration of the Big Ten's deal. That means Oregon and Washington, and possibly Stanford and Cal as well. And if any combination of those schools do leave for the Big Ten, then it makes more sense to me for most of the remaining schools to join the Big 12 than it does for them to try to keep the husk of the Pac-12 conference alive (much of this also applies to the ACC once we're closer to the expiration of its deal).

And the academic argument makes some sense, although I don't know if I buy it to the extent of the OP. I know that the Big Ten Academic Alliance is a huge deal. I actually think that, more than athletics, is why any university president would immediately jump at the chance to join that conference. I know that the Big 12 conference has no academic component. The Pac-12, ACC and SEC are all somewhere in between those extremes but I'm skeptical of just how much of a factor they will ultimately play in realignment. The Big Ten Academic Alliance produces over $10 billion of research annually. I haven't seen any evidence that the corresponding groups at the ACC, Pac-12 or SEC are remotely close to that.",OriginalOmagus,2023-03-19,Ireland

And of course, even the FBS has, at least in practice, split into a ""power 5"" and ""group of 5"" conference structure for football.

They’re part of the UC system—Cal is the top public research school in the nation, UCLA has a bigger research support desk than Cal, and already have have access to other universities with more research support like UC Davis.  Research assistance might matter to Utah, but it’s not like their grants (1% increase in grants/contracts per year since they joined the PAC, and 7% annual increase in grant dollars since joining the PAC) have been growing dramatically and are mostly clinical trials at their medical school for DHHS.

What’s more likely is that Cal drops athletics entirely because they won’t have enough revenue to support their programs on the new deal.  

Also, if Oregon leaves for the BIG10–which is highly likely because they were supposed to go in place of UCLA originally per the ASU president, and their board hired a new president from the University of Wisconsin with ties to BIG10 officials and presidents and who won’t publicly comment on his commitment to the PAC—then the only schools the PAC would be able to recruit would be MWC and WAC schools whose markets and sports programs are smaller than Utah’s.  Utah is one of the smallest schools in terms of athletic revenues and other schools (SDSU and SMU which are in the pipeline, and Boise State who they already turned down) wouldn’t get an invite because they’d dilute media revenue per school even further.  Also, they would not be on par academically with the schools that would be leaving.

Right now PAC schools are watching to make sure the media deal money is comparable to the BIG12, and then they’ll decide whether to sign on and backfill membership with their academic “weak sisters of the poor” from smaller markets with vague plans maybe ally with the remaining ACC members when their media contract expires, or start talks with the BIG12 in earnest because the PAC can’t sustain itself.",brpajense,2023-03-19,Ireland

Second, as unhealthy as it may be, a lot of players really will continue playing with an injury. When you see the medics run out onto the field, often all they do is apply a numbing spray. That way, the team doesn't have to give up one of it's valuable subs.

And of course, the way soccer works, if the ref didn't see it then it didn't happen. We'll have to see if there are any changes made now that VAR is a thing.",El_Rey_247,2019-06-15,Ireland

Student: No, Sir.

Krishnamurti: But the older people do not know either. They sit in a corner, close their eyes and concentrate, like school boys trying to concentrate on a book. That is not meditation. Meditation is something extraordinary, if you know how to do it. I am going to talk a little about it.

First of all, sit very quietly; do not force yourself to sit quietly, but sit or lie down quietly without force of any kind. Do you understand? Then watch your thinking. Watch what you are thinking about. You find you are thinking about your shoes, your saris, what you are going to say, the bird outside to which you listen; follow such thoughts and enquire why each thought arises.

Do not try to change your thinking. See why certain thoughts arise in your mind so that you begin to understand the meaning of every thought and feeling without any enforcement. And when a thought arises, do not condemn it, do not say it is right, it is wrong, it is good, it is bad. Just watch it, so that you begin to have a perception, a consciousness which is active in seeing every kind of thought, every kind of feeling. You will know every hidden secret thought, every hidden motive, every feeling, without distortion, without saying it is right, wrong, good or bad. When you look, when you go into thought very very deeply, your mind becomes extraordinarily subtle, alive. No part of the mind is asleep. The mind is completely awake.

That is merely the foundation. Then your mind is very quiet. Your whole being becomes very still. Then go through that stillness, deeper, further – that whole process is meditation. Meditation is not to sit in a corner repeating a lot of words; or to think of a picture and go into some wild, ecstatic imaginings

To understand the whole process of your thinking and feeling is to be free from all thought, to be free from all feeling so that your mind, your whole being becomes very quiet. And that is also part of life and with that quietness, you can look at the tree, you can look at people, you can look at the sky and the stars. That is the beauty of life.",SexuallyTrusstraited,2023-03-19,Ireland

There are 8 limbs in yoga. The first 5 are to align yourself and the last 3 are deep meditative states. The first five limbs consist of (and I am trying to be accessible here): 

1. Yama (self truthfulness)
2. Niyama (focus)
3. Asana (movement)
4. Pranayama (perfect balance of breath)
5. Pratyahara (unagitated perception)
6. ....and after these are the meditative states

When you work out you generally meet these in some way. Now, are you going to get to a non-contemplative state of meditation from these...well, I don't think so.  

When I was younger, I was always told that ""praying"" was not ""worshiping"" the gods. Being focused, disciplined, and diligent with what you love was ""worshipping"" the gods...I think this shows the abstract nature of some of these ancient forms of mindfulness.

Sports Degree AND Gym OR Swimming OR GAA OR Rugby OR Soccer OR Football,https://www.reddit.com/r/karate/comments/125pxey/when_choosing_between_karate_and_tkd_is_it/,"When choosing between Karate and TKD, is it correct to assume that Karate still has some degree of self-defense to it and retains more traditional moves, and TKD is more of a focus of prepping for the Olympic sport?","The only correct assumption is that it depends on the school.  

Honestly, it comes down to two things:  Are they training hard, and are they pressure testing?  In other words, are people learning to hit hard, move effectively, building strength and endurance; and are they getting a chance to try what they're learning against an opponent who isn't just letting them do it?

If a school is doing those two things, it's reasonable to assume you'll be a better fighter as an outcome.  If a school isn't doing those two things - both of them - it's reasonable to assume the opposite.

Schools that focus completely on Olympic style light-contact sparring aren't going to be that useful for self-defense.  Neither are schools that focus completely on kata, or on other forms of light-contact or no-contact sparring.  Whether it's karate, or TKD - or boxing, or any other system - if you aren't doing both of those things, you aren't learning to fight effectively.

I've seen plenty of karate schools that don't - and I've seen plenty of TKD schools that do.  Granted, there are a lot of TKD schools that are geared toward the Olympic stuff - so maybe in terms of sheer numbers your assumption might be correct - but it'd be a shame if you passed up a good school just because it was TKD versus karate.

One of my old students - he's moved away years ago - was a TKD black belt before he came to our club.  I don't recall the actual style, but he definitely knew how to fight.  I ended up incorporating some of his stuff into my own.  It definitely wasn't Olympic anything.  

My point is, you can use style as sort of a general guide; but you really can't tell until you see the school or you see the people who train there.  I understand that here on the interweb, folks like to make broad sweeping generalizations about which style is better or worse; but the reality is that it really comes down to the actual training.",Wilbie9000,2023-03-29,Ireland

I have a black belt in WTF Taekwondo and just started Goju-ryu karate in January. It’s going to depend really heavily on the school + master, first of all, and quite a bit on the style too. 

My TKD master is pretty old school and didn’t subscribe too heavily to WTF styles, though we were a WTF school. A more modern WTF school might be a lot more Olympic-styled. I know quite a bit of self-defense from TKD and it was an important part of our testing. The same is true in my karate. I can fight pretty well courtesy of my TKD training, and though we don’t heavily spar at karate, we do a lot of one-tap drills and I can see how that’ll turn my classmates into decent fighters in the long term too. 

It’s really all about the feeling. Go check out the local schools for both and see if you like how they feel, how it’s run, who teaches, etc. A good school will let you do a trial lesson. I switched to karate because the TKD schools in my area are black belt factories and charge 2-3x what my karate dojo does.",flipfreakingheck,2023-03-29,Ireland

TLDR: take a hard look at your motivations, goals, benefits and costs. Be deliberate in any decision and not hasty.

Edit: and know that **it is ok to wrestle with whether or not to keep doing things, even things you love**. It doesn't make you disloyal or ungrateful or a quitter or anything like that. It is normal and good to do so.

Long version:

One of the hardest parts of adult life is managing all the things you want to do. Do the things you want to do actually bring you joy or happiness or value and does that outweigh the risks or costs of them?

Whenever I have struggled with whether to continue something I have enjoyed, I try to ask myself ""what am I giving up to continue [this thing]? Is that a price I am willing to pay?""

I enjoy it, but it means an extra 8 hours of commute every week or less time with my family or it costs money that could be spent on something else or my grades are suffering or my friendships or my professional goals. Does it fit into your long term goals for this month/year/decade?

And how much longer does the cost go on vs the gain? Can I finish out the current project/event/class/show and then recover for a bit and be ready to jump back in? 

And, are you doing it for you or because other people expect it of you? There is nothing wrong with continuing on for other people's sake, but if you do, be sure you are ok with that motivation. It is easy to get crushed by other peoples' expectations.

Take your time to decide and also ask those close to you. Maybe they have similar feelings and insight. Don't rush into a decision that you can't take back.",themattboard,2022-11-10,Ireland

I think first and foremost, you should try to get in front of a sports psychologist if your team/athletic department has one. I went through a period where I was so anxious about going to practice and working out that I was intensely negative in my thoughts and speaking, and I'm sure this impacted my performance. If your not having fun, you're not going to get peak performance, and right now it sounds like you're underwater on stress and metrics for performance. Sports can be really hard and fun at the same time, and a good sports psych can help you get into the right mindset to find that. 

Second, there's more value to a player's career than being a starter. I really mean that. Sometimes when your not traveling or riding the bench, you just have to tell yourself that you're helping make your teammates better. If your coach truly thought you had no business on the field, then you wouldn't be on the team at all. Think about the things you can bring to your team beyond starting at your position. Things like leadership, work ethic, positive attitude, and guidance for younger players. I think if you can find a role for yourself that's not strictly defined by performance, you can get back to enjoying yourself. 

As far as being in pain all the time, unfortunately that's just the game to some degree. Do make sure your diet is on point, that you're eating enough to recover, because under-fueling can definitely make soreness worse and more lingering. 

I guess my thesis is to try to learn to have fun in the game again. Performance will follow. Take some of the pressure off of yourself, and if you truly find that without the pressure and anxiety you still feel that you're not enjoying it, then it may be time to quit, but to me it doesn't sound like you're there yet.",Ja_red_,2022-11-10,Ireland

I decided to pursue my MBA and that decision has set me up for a comfortable life with no regrets.

Most people do not play football after college, the NFL is a small % of players who are either really talented or just really want it (Kurt Warner).

You probably won't be playing football in a few years, do you want to make the most of it now and enjoy the game while you can?  Once you take those shoulder pads and helmet off the last time, that's it.

Perspective: you are on scholarship and getting paid to play essentially.  You could look at it as a job: I do this and I get a free undergrad degree, maybe some post grad because of COVID.

You can simply look at it as a transaction: do my hours of my job, get free college and all that goes with it.  Use the discipline and structure learned by playing football paired with the education you received to find a job you like post football and school.

They would be able to give you some tools that could help you dig down and weigh out all your options, and help you make a decision. At the end of the day, you’ll need to evaluate what you want, what some of your goals are, pros and cons, etc, which isn’t easy, but talking to a professional can help you organize your current thoughts and feelings into an action plan. 

Also, you definitely sound burnt out, and burn out is doubly hard when it’s with something you love. Do you take time out for yourself during the day? As a football player, you have a pretty set daily schedule, so make sure you block out time for you. 5, 10, 15mins, an hour, whatever time block you want. In this block, only do stuff for you - watch Netflix, read a book, cook, go on a walk outside and be in nature (off your phone), go to a coffee shop, anything. Is there some building on campus you haven’t been in yet that you’ve always said “I’ll go check it out one day”, go do it. You’ve given so much time to football, so make sure you give some time back to yourself. 

Wish you good luck man. If something no longer brings you joy, it’s ok to leave. It’s also ok to reconnect with it and find that joy again. But do talk to a professional, since they can give you better tools and advice than any one of us on reddit can.",doodoobyscooby,2022-11-10,Ireland

I still stuck with it and gave the team my all because I didn’t want to let them down, while my season got cut short with an injury towards the end, I have 0 regrets about continuing to play. 

One thing about football for most people is that you’re going to be completely done at a certain point, other athletes don’t realize that. You can go play a pickup game of soccer, basketball, baseball etc but you’ll have very limited opportunities to play organized football again (unless there’s some minor league teams). 

Talk to a counselor or sports psychologist about it, ultimately that is the best thing you can do. Your passion can wane but this is a fleeting opportunity. While you might not make it to the NFL, the game you love will be gone one day. I had a coach who I laughed at when he said “you’ll never know when your last play is” but it’s actually true.

Do what is best for you man, your hard work is still noticed as you got to that level but don’t let not being the big man on campus anymore take that away from you.

Bottom line - college is an investment. Unless you have a legit shot at pro ball, athletics are a humongous time sink that limit your return on that investment.  If you aren't loving it, move on.

It's something I've long wondered about kids that get to the very competitive levels of sports but where the odds that they are going to turn pro and make money out of it are slim. 

Generally, my advice would be: 

**If you think there is long-term value in sticking it out**, then look for some support, talk your coaches, and try to stick it out. It may be therapy, it may be working with your coaches on how to work through the burn-out, it may be changing your expectations or re-evaluating your motivation. There's probably a path there, but to me, it has the pre-requisite that there is going to be long-term value in doing so.

**If you don't think there is long-term value in sticking it out,** then don't. I think for a lot of people it's hard to walk away from things they have invested a lot of time in, but if the answer is ""no, the thing that I am doing is delivering all the value it will deliver right now"", then you have to like it in order to keep doing it.

I'll give you my personal story (which is *totally* different) and why I decided to stick it out:

I finished my master's and was 2 years into my PhD. And I was burnt the fuck out. I didn't really feel like I was doing well enough in classes, I didn't really have a research path that I felt strongly about, I kept seeing my friends and classmates start working and making legit money, buying houses, going on vacations, getting new cars, and I was just sitting there going ""dude, why am I doing this?"". I called it my mid-grad school life crisis.

I talked to my advisor about it - and to other classmates - and ultimately decided that there was long-term value in sticking it out; that if I was able to power through, getting that degree would open doors that I would otherwise not have available to me.

So, to me, the long-term value was there.  So I stuck it out, and it worked  out - I eventually founda research topic I felt great about, I graduated, and everything professionally after that has kinda worked out. 

So that would be my advice for you - think about what your future looks like if you quit football. And think of what your future looks like if you don't. And if the future with football isn't meaningfully better than the one without it...",dfphd,2022-11-10,Ireland

If you decide that playing isn't for you anymore and you've lost the fire for being on the field, there are lots of ways to stay involved. Can you finish school and pick up a GA position? Would you think about coaching or officiating?

When you commit to doing something for so long, eventually, you're going to wonder if you should keep doing it. No one on Reddit is going to give you the right answer.

And above all you should know that there is zero shame in making the best choice for yourself and doing what will make you happy, and people who really care about you will understand and will not judge you for one second.

Have you reached out to your old high school coach who helped guide you and who you referred to as a father figure, to let him know how you're feeling and to seek his advice? He sounds like a supportive person, and any good coach understands the toll that the sport can have on people and has probably had other players feel the same or have thought it himself.

Also wanted to say that I've been in your shoes but in different ways. I absolutely loved football my freshman and sophomore years of high school and had lots of good friends through the team, but by junior and senior year I was a lot more focused on school and spending time with my ""nerdy"" friends. By the end, football for me was kind of like ""what am I doing here?"" I'm glad I stuck with it, but I was never that good and knew I had no future in football past high school and my regrets with sticking it out were more along the lines of letting my football friendships fall by the wayside. I also dealt with similar issues in college, but that was related to me spreading myself way too thin with extracurriculars and had to cut back to focus on one. Ultimately, now that I'm in my 30s, I think what I would do differently is not trying to live up to everyone's expectations for me or trying to do too much and just focus on one or two things that I enjoy the most and can dedicate myself to it.",WampaStompa33,2022-11-10,Ireland

Honestly, the only viewpoint/advice I can give is - if you take a long, hard, honest look at the situation and I mean truly honest and you tell yourself ""I don't want to do this anymore"", don't keep doing it. Maybe take some time to experience the world and find something that you do enjoy, because it sounds like you've been focused on football for so long that you haven't had that opportunity. 

Maybe you love D&D or watercolor painting or opera or ultimate frisbee, and you just don't know it yet because you haven't had to explore things that aren't football. 

But most importantly - always remember that you're gonna have people in your life who are gonna love you and support you whatever decision you make.

So I put it out of mind. As the year went on, I got a few letters and even a few colleges showing actual interest (small d3 schools). Since I couldn’t really rely on my coach, I reached out to someone I knew who played at the college level. Their advice was that if I didn’t eat, breathe, and sleep the sport, don’t do it. The time commitment impacts every single other part of your experience. As such, I did not choose to play and feel in my case I made the right choice.

Don't feel obligated to play until you run out of eligibility, but it's hard to overstate how life changing a college degree is. Especially if you come from a small town where that's not particularly common (which I'm assuming is true based off of what you said, but that's an assumption by me and we might have a different definition of small town).

Definitely talk to a professional to see if it's more serious than it appears in your post, but to me it sounds like you're just burnt out. If you're still feeling like this after Christmas break (I'm not sure if D2 playoffs go that late/if your team is going to be in D2 playoffs), I'd ask coach if you can start off season workouts a bit later because of burnout. Assuming your coach isn't a total asswipe/knows anything about sports psychology, he won't get mad or punish you for this.

Though if you really, really, really hate it (it doesn't sound like you're there yet and are just pushing yourself a bit too hard), do quit.

I'm 29 now, and football is definitely in my rear-view now, but I can relate so much to everything you said. 

In high school, I had the time of my life playing football. I truly loved the game. When I played in college(also at a D-2 school) it was dang-near miserable. It felt like it sucked the fun out of the game I once loved. It especially became less interesting when it set in that my goals of making it to the NFL would never happen. Not to mention I could feel my body breaking down. It took longer to recover from soreness than before. I still wonder how in the world do some guys play football til they're 40. I will never understand. 

Unfortunately, I wish I had an answer for you. But I don't. My football career ended up being taken from me due to things out of my control. I will say that my senior year of college, I really didn't miss football. I felt free. I could do what I want It was such a relief to not be at the athletic building 25+hours a week. 

Looking back. Sometimes I do miss playing football. I do sometimes miss the comradery that I had with my brothers. I miss the feeling that I was going to war with other people who I knew had my back. I miss the celebrations with those brothers when we just won a ""war"". I see 2 of my former teammates balling in the NFL, and I sometimes think, ""that could've been me. I used to compete right there with them on the same level"". But at the same time, football doesn't define me. Don't let it define you. Life after ball does exist. 

Talk to your mom, your high school coaches. If you have a good relationship with any of your college coaches, talk to them(I didn't, part of the reason why I hated college ball). Talk to some trusted teammates.  This is your life. You decide which way you want to go. Just as they see, live everyday like it's your last.

Osorio later became coach of Mexico for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.","Relevant extract from the 2017 article:

> To chase his dream, Osorio sold the small gym he had, packed his bags, temporarily left his wife -- as well as the chance of becoming a U.S. citizen -- and headed to Liverpool.

> After trying and failing to talk his way into Liverpool's training ground, Osorio scouted the area and found a hole in the wall along Crown Road. It was then that he knocked on the McManus family's door, initially to ask for some steps to enable him to look over the high wall and onto the training pitches. Mary answered and said she didn't have any, but was impressed by Osorio's politeness and went back out to offer him a table. Osorio returned the table and even cleaned it.

> The next day Osorio, accompanied by his omnipresent notebook and pens, came back.

> After a few days, Osorio asked to live at the house and although at first Mary declined, the family agreed that it would be a good idea after talking more with the now 56-year-old, though they struggle to put their finger on exactly why.

> [...] Osorio stayed in the McManus household for two years while he completed his degree and became an important person in their lives. When he came back to northwest England in 2001 to become the fitness coach (and later assistant) at Manchester City under Kevin Keegan, the former Atletico Nacional manager used to return with his wife and children for the traditional English Christmas dinner with the McManus family.

> Stints in MLS with Chicago Fire and New York Red Bulls followed; then came his real breakthrough in Colombia with Once Caldas and then Atletico Nacional. From there, Osorio moved to Sao Paulo in Brazil before taking on the significant challenge of managing the Mexican national team, where he is proving successful so far.

> ""What he showed to me and I think to our two boys hi is that if you want to achieve anything in life, you've got to be single-minded and totally determined to go for it,"" said Tom, who works as a carpenter and joiner and plays music in his spare time.

> ""Nothing gets in his way. From the day we met him and found out what he was about, we knew he would be successful and he is and I think he can go further again.""",twiggez-vous,2021-01-17,Ireland

I very much doubt Nets will trade him now, more than likely he will stick around to see if they can surround him with some talent for this run and make a decision in the offseason but I fully expect him to request a trade again in June. 

I have previously expressed my concern with Blazers’ ‘win-now’ strategy and desire to allow Dame to win the championship as it would require us to surround him with at least one player that is better than him and there are very few of them, they also hardly ever become available. Durant is one and he also happens to be the best fit next to Lillard. 

When it comes to assets we have two promising young players with strong value in Simons and Sharpe. Simons has already proven to be an exciting player and is under good deal for another three years after this season, Sharpe is on a rookie deal, has shown promise and could develop into a player you could build around. As for draft capital we can go two ways about it: if our 2023 pick conveys to Chicago, all our future picks become unencumbered. If it doesn’t, it means we will likely have a top 10 pick to trade this year and could still lift protections from the 2024 pick we would now owe to Chicago, and that would ensure we could trade all our picks from 2026 until 2030. These are also the sort of picks Nets would likely covet as with Dame and KD as our leading players with hardly any young talent you could see Portland becoming terrible from 2026 onwards (it is pretty much a given that we are going to be extremely bad).

I don’t think any team could match that offer all things considered, KD would probably feel OK playing with Dame as it would be his best shot at winning and with Dame, KD and Grant already there we could basically surround them with any serviceable shooter and center and be an instant contender.

They tend to have most of the same requirements as a normal business from a legal perspective but the regulations/contract formats (see the PL’s standard player contract)/etc will be specific to football.

Consider what it is about football and law you find interesting. Is it the commercial side (think how clubs make money and all the agreements that go into that like broadcasting and sponsorship), is it intellectual property, is it the movement of players and employment issues they may face. There’s so much that goes into it, saying you like football law won’t be enough to convince anybody.

In terms of getting into it, lots of firms have sports work in their teams, particularly commercial and employment. There are also quite a few firms which focus primarily on sports. This is the best way to get the experience necessary to end up working in football. I once emailed a sports law firm in London explaining how much I enjoy it and they let me come to their office for a few days and shadow. That sounds like a grandma asking why you don’t just send someone a letter but it did work for me.

I second the Mishcon sports law academy which is really good and gives great examples of the sort of work you would do.

If you can’t get a vac scheme or TC or any experience at a place that does sports, don’t despair. Focus on the area of law you enjoy the most beyond purely relating to football. Focus on getting as much experience as you can and qualifying. You can then make the move after qualification. I worked in commercial law focused on tech and media and I had an offer after qualification from a top 4 club which I didn’t take for multiple reasons.",Thrillho994,2022-08-08,Ireland

First, we have sports options that aren't 'sports breaks during the regularly scheduled ads' so the duration looses some appeal there. Then, because of timezones, super bowl is on a Monday here. As great as sitting down to eat shit food and sink grog all day is, can't do it at work. And it's just not worth the holiday when we have local test match cricket which is five days of sitting outside in the sun with your mates eating food and sinking grog.

Supported Chargers when Jnr Seau played as he was the best. Difficult to track a single team nowadays. You only get one or two random games a week on SKY, Monday afternoons. But found that the highlights from NFL showing on YouTube are fantastic and let you watch every game each week in 10-12min clips. I end up waiting until Tuesday then binge-watching for an hour all game highlights from the weekend. Very satisfying. 

Still love NFL. We host an annual Superbowl party on the Monday and take the day off to watch. Drink terrible American beer and make hot dogs / Philly Cheese Steaks, hamburgers, etc. Always ends ups being a great day. God Bless America... on Superbowl Monday (NZT).",Cooldayla,2021-01-18,Ireland
