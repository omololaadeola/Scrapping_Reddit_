Your main problems will be threefold, though.  
1. Command of the German language is a must as a teacher; at least level C1.  
2. German teachers usually teach two separate subjects. And I mean *separate*; my P.E. teachers in school also taught geography, math, or biology.

Disturbing: ""Girls will dress sexy to get good grades from male teachers."" I might ask follow ups to that to put the responsibility on the school such as

Have there been problems with teachers molesting students at this school? If so, how were those issues addressed? Are there any teachers currently at this school whom I should know about and keep an eye on to better protect my students?

Also a bit disturbing: the one calling out a particular girl for her breasts. It appears that whoever said this is sexualizing the body of a child.

One thing I will mention from my own pre-pubescent and pubescent years was that at that age I experimented a lot with fashion and looks and so did a lot of the other kids. I went through lots of fashion phases including sometimes wearing crop tops and short babydoll dresses and sometimes clown-levels of make up. Eventually I kind of figured out what I was comfortable with and settled into a more consistent style. In retrospect I think it was empowering as a girl to be able to decide for myself what I myself was comfortable wearing in the world.

With regards to the boys getting distracted thing, it is important that boys learn from a young age what is appropriate behavior and that they are ultimately responsible for their behavior. Getting practice early on in being respectful regardless of what a girl or woman is wearing is invaluable, especially when there is a compassionate male authority figure to calmly correct unacceptable behavior and be available to discuss it with the boys. You can tell your fellow teachers that it's actually a great opportunity for a male authority figure to provide compassionate guidance to these boys about how to navigate respectfully among women and girls in the real world.",BubblySolid6,2023-01-27,Ireland

Arguing with other teachers/administrators is kind of useless in my opinion. The way the dress code got changed at the school I work at is that teachers supported the students who were complaining about the dress code and helped them stand up for themselves to the administrators and get the rules changed. 

Bonus points if you encourage male students to stand up against the dress code also--it's especially entertaining if a boy breaks dress code every day for a month (not a single administrator will notice or care), then politely asks why the girls get punished instantly the second they wear something ""distracting."" 

Of course in the mean time just ignore it if someone breaks dress code in your class. Make sure you understand the power structure in your school--in the US there is an elected ""school board"" that oversees the district. This school board is usually required to hold public meetings so that people in the district can voice concerns.

That is a terrifying answer. I hope you can call out and expose the fucked up person who said that.

I think an expectation the students wear attire that is a appropriate and functional to the workout they are doing makes sense (so long as you can also provide backups to students who have trouble getting clothes that meet that criteria). Anything other than that is outlandish and illustrates a serious problem with the adults enforcing the rule. I can imagine that it must be tough to constantly have to punish 15 year old boys for staring inappropriately at women, but disciplining children is unfortunately part of the job of being a teacher at that level. And all the stuff about sexualizing the attire choices of your students is beyond fricked.

That said, is there not a good argument to be made that students should have to wear a separate T-Shirt for gym class? Seems to me you want to be able to ensure students aren't A) getting their regular clothes sweaty and B) are wearing something they won't be afraid of getting damaged (preventing them from putting in effort). They always made everyone wear the same ugly gym shirt when I was in HS for those reasons and it honestly made sense to me.",notsoinsaneguy,2023-01-27,Ireland

This gives the impression of having been a tactical mistake. The policy was already enacted, so it already had majority support among your colleagues. You need allies to push back against groupthink.

If you have tenure then you should be free to network with students and their parents to push back more effectively and get the dress code changed.

There are kids who are good at sports involving a ball, and then there are losers.

""You play defense"" is code for ""you're terrible""

Being picked last for any kind of team pair-off because you only see out of one eye at a time and can't track a moving object in 3D makes you not give a shit about the subject

Everything makes you sore, out of breath, or embarrassed.

Encouraging people by bullying, and homophobic or sexist taunts (""pick up the pace girls!"" to a pack of young men etc) is a perfectly acceptable technique

Some kids who spent their formative years in something like gymnastics class are light years ahead of you so don't bother

Oh, and running is a literal punishment because it's boring and unpleasant.

Never learned how to figure out how much to eat and follow that, find a sport I actually liked to stay active, how to structure an exercise routine or anything else.

He also emphasized how exercise helps our mental health and emotional health.

When you are a teenager, education isn‚Äôt focused only on academics. That comes later on, in college or university, when you choose the scope of your education.

It‚Äôs hard to put into words. In Denmark, we call it ‚Äòalmen dannelse‚Äô, which directly translates to general education, but it really means that your education is focused on molding you into becoming a better citizen. You are taught math, poetry, history, philosophy, literature, English, Latin, French, German, music, and most importantly for this post: sport.

You don‚Äôt need any of these things in your everyday life, but you do need these things to be *educated*. It is also very beneficial for your learning and health. Most teenagers need to exercise more, especially in America where some are fucking round.

Also: ‚ÄòJocks picking on nerds‚Äô?! Are you from an 80‚Äôs movie? Academics and fitness aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.

>New Jersey certification is required for any professional staff member employed in New Jersey public schools or in any institution under the supervision of the New Jersey Department of Education, including charter schools and educational facilities within the Department of Corrections, Juvenile Justice Commission and the Department of Human Services.


>CE -¬†The Certificate of Eligibility (CE) is a credential with lifetime validity issued to an individual who has NOT completed a teacher preparation program, but who has met the basic requirements for certification including academic study and applicable test requirements. The CE authorizes an individual to seek and accept employment in NJ public schools requiring certification.

Here is the document with CE requirements:

https://nj.gov/education/license/endorsements/1630CE.pdf


>Degree Requirement
‚Ä¢ A minimum of a bachelor‚Äôs degree is required from a regionally accredited college/university.


>Cumulative GPA Requirement
‚Ä¢ New Jersey requires that candidates for certification achieve a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 when a GPA of 4.00 equals an A grade for students graduating on or after September 1, 2016 (2.75 for those graduating before September 1, 2016) in a baccalaureate degree program, higher degree program or a State-approved post-
baccalaureate certification program with a minimum of 13 semester-hour credits. 

>‚Ä¢ Please note that there are GPA Flexibility Rules where a high praxis score may offset a GPA that is lower than 3.0, but higher than 2.75.


>Subject Matter Preparation
‚Ä¢ For certification as a Physical Education teacher, current regulations require that applicants complete a minimum of 30 credits in a coherent sequence in the subject field of Physical Education. A coherent sequence requires that at least 12 credits are completed at the advanced level of study (junior, senior or graduate level). Examples of courses 
accepted for physical education include: fundamental skills and exercises, gymnastics, individual sports, dual sports, 
team sports, golf, tennis and basketball. Related courses may be accepted depending on the course 
description/content. Please provide a course description if a course is not taken from the Physical Education 
Department. Courses in pedagogy/education are not accepted towards the subject matter preparation. The final determination as to which courses will be counted towards the Physical Education subject matter is based on professional and content standards found in the NJ Licensing Code. All credits must appear on a regionally accredited 2 or 4 year college/university transcript.


>Testing Requirements
‚Ä¢ Praxis II Test Requirement
Official scores must be presented directly from Educational Testing Service to the NJ Department of Education. Only official scores are accepted. The New Jersey Department of Education code (R7666) and your Social Security

However, I am not sure how much that would transfer over to physical training. Of course, more information is better but if you aren't planning on teaching pilates you might be better off finding a more appropriate program to your area of interest and do pilates sessions with a skilled teacher on the side. 

You could also do general anatomy and physiology for personal trainers. Where I am in Canada trainers have lots of options for continuing ed after you have your initial certification so it may just be a matter of building your knowledge and experience gradually.

I‚Äôm training through Club Pilates. I choose them because the are the most accessible club to people and I believe accessibility is the most important thing on the plant. The second reason is that all instructors education comes down to how good the master trainer is. My CP master trainer is absolutely incredible. I can‚Äôt praise her enough. CP revamped their program to be more respected and it shows. I visited multiple Pilates studios hosting instructor courses, I kept coming back to CP because of the master trainer. Where you choose to do your education should be picked because of the master trainer preforming the education. Take classes from them prior, get to know how they teach and if you feel like they are a good one. A clients success in Pilates is because they have a great instructor. If the class is struggling, it‚Äôs because the instructor isn‚Äôt doing a good job.

I choose to focus on contemporary over classical because contemporary incorporates what has been learned from physical therapist.  Example: Joseph Pilates taught everything in flat back, we now know that‚Äôs not always the  best option. 

Once I complete my foundational education ie mat, reformer, chair, ect. I will then begin training on special populations. There are many specialized certifications you can get to expand your knowledge and practice base. Ex: I want to begin and pre and post natal care, I will go through that certification process, then move on to other special pops certification. There are so many options out there and I will collect them like Pok√©mon haha. 

Look on indeed and talk to physical therapy offices in the area to find out what they are looking for in a Pilates instructor. That will give you a really good starting point on what additional certifications they are looking for.

-I don‚Äôt think these ‚Äúexperts‚Äù and ‚Äúadvocates‚Äù have actually been in a classroom in many years.

Sometimes there are multiple IEP students with multiple needs, in addition to the gen Ed students, that teachers can‚Äôt do it all perfectly all the time, all throughout the day. There are too many unknowns and home-based contributing factors that can lead to an already frustrated student walking into the classroom. 

- it‚Äôs frustrating that schools cannot respond to allegations because of privacy laws. It leaves their media representation very skewed; no wonder the general public has such disdain towards teachers, they can never hear the other side. 

- parents are quick to point fingers because the only alternative is admitting fault themselves. Our natural egocentric tendency to persevere and appear unblemished to others (society) is not taken into account here.",mishulyia,2023-02-17,Ireland

What can and should be done with special ed kids with a history of violent, unmanageable behavior?","Thanks for the great discussion and also the link to the USA Today article (which I hadn't seen before). The reporting was excellent and detailed.

I am also a special education teacher, and I love working with emotionally and behaviorally challenged youth. I will take that population seven days a week over any other.

However, the general education setting is in many cases not the appropriate LRE for students with even mild to moderate behaviors.

I've been around a while, taught in some pretty intense places (still do) and I've seen a lot of crazy - assaults, weapons, drugs, electronic monitoring, alternative placements, the gamut.

I have never taught a child as disturbed as this six year old. His reported behaviors go way, way beyond an unstable, violent, antisocial home life. There is something biologically, physiologically wrong with this young man. An IEP alone, no matter how restrictive, won't fix him.

This young man should not have been in his neighborhood school at all, but at minimum he should have been assigned a dedicated 1:1 aide who never left his side. The district was long aware of this student's extreme, bizarre, psychopathic behavior and did nothing to protect their employees, or other students attending this school.

At six years old and  in the first grade, most children who receive IEPs are just beginning to show up on the radar for an initial evaluation. That's when any glaring deficits or atypicalities are going to be taken more seriously and not simply chalked up to normal differences in the rate of development between similarly aged children.  But this child had already attempted to kill his kindergarten teacher via strangulation with his belt, if memory serves. That should have been enough, right there, to get him out of that building via diagnostic placement, change of placement, expulsion - whatever mechanism deemed most appropriate. I'm frankly gobsmacked that he was allowed to stay in that school after such a serious incident.

There's obviously a LOT more to this story than any of us (except those directly involve) know at this point. I tend to agree that this young man likely did not have a formal IEP-if he did, the district is out of compliance and blatantly negligent not to provide a 1:1 aide and instead enlist the parents to serve in that capacity. The other thing to consider is that the district may have wished to avoid the optics of white teachers and administrators taking this kind of restrictive action against a student of color. I don't think the young man's racial background has been made public, but I understand this is a possible issue at play here.",DystopianNerd,2023-02-17,Ireland

No. However it's been taken to an absurd extreme beyond the preview of the original intent.

When a student is having violent outbursts like flipping tables in the middle of class because of some trigger, which frightens (and thus interferes with the learning of) other students, it's now violating the rights of the other students.

Your right to swing your arms stop at someone else's face: thus your right to be in the least restrictive environment stops when it begins restricting the rights of others.

He punched staff and students, bit people, sexually assaulted more than one person, destroyed any classroom he was in, and self-harmed in class. This was a 250 lb high-school student with an IQ of 60. He could do some damage. One time, he punched through a window, cut his arm all up, and went around flinging blood onto people. Even heavily medicated (he was on daily doses of lithium and haloperidol and several others), it was like he was holding onto a live wire.

He was put into an inpatient facility several times during his five years in high school (SPED students can delay graduation) and even the staff there had trouble handling him. Eventually, he always ended up back at the school because the district didn't want to pay for the inpatient treatment. It was not okay.",roadkill6,2023-02-17,Ireland

One of the few good things to come from the pandemic was the reminder that if a student has an illness (Covid, the flu, polio, whatever) that can harm their classmates, that individual needs to be quarantined for the health and safety of the larger group.

Mental health needs to treated comparably to physical health in this aspect. If a student has a mental illness that makes them a danger to the group, then that child needs to be quarantined.

It‚Äôs not the child or the family‚Äôs fault that the child is ill, but it is their responsibility to ensure that illness does not harm others.

We need more mental health facilities as places to quarantine these kids, we need lots of them and we need them now.

You identified yourself as a sped teacher in the title, but you describe yourself with, ""I write IEPs and help special ed kids for a living.""  Thanks for the truth.  Because the truth is this: if you really want to be a sped teacher, then you need to be a reg ed teacher.  They are the ones who actually teach sped students.  Sped professionals - who we desperately need for support - do far more bookkeeping than teaching.

For the first 10 years of teaching, I seldom had more than one or two students with IEPs - and never any with serious concerns.  I could always follow the IEP and gladly folded them in.

But the last 15 out of 25 (I retired in June, 2022), I always had at least 4 IEPs- one of them with serious concerns - a couple on 504s, and a couple that needed to be evaluated.  So 20 to 25% of my students.

Whenever I pushed for more services for them, I was told point-blank that I had no right to speak up because I was not a sped professional.  Parents are easily talked out of more sped time because administrators can point to the IEP and state that the reg ed teacher has to do a better job with IEP accommodations before more support can be given.  Parents LOVE to hear that their disabled child can succeed without more support.  They interpret that as, ""My kid isn't that disabled.""

Meanwhile, state testing scores for disabled students are BAD.  If special education worked, they would be far more in line with reg ed kids.",MantaRay2256,2023-02-17,Ireland

These teachers would not quit after getting punched, bit, or told fuck you on a regular basis with furniture thrown at them (so pay them more, and give them hazard pay). Psychiatrists and psychologists would also be in the building assisting daily. 

Integration and inclusivity was a misdirected response to equality and a politically correct society. 

The glaring problems soon emerged of chaos in the classrooms because of a handful of special
education students disrupting the class, being violent to other kids and the teachers within an overcrowded classroom with a state mandated curriculum with schools getting dinged when their sped ed students are not achieving (while ignoring that many can not achieve on the same level, hence their accommodation and modification paperwork). 

There is a reason for mass teacher shortages, and even bigger shortages in special education. No more studies need to be done on why there are shortages. We know all the reason.

The thing is, to the best of my knowledge, it has never been confirmed that this child has an IEP. His parents, through their attorney, have used some vague language like ‚Äúacute disability‚Äù in an effort to evade responsibility for their gross negligence. I taught in Virginia and every other teacher I‚Äôve spoken to in the state believes it‚Äôs much more likely the child either had not been evaluated due to parental refusal, or that the parents refused to accept an identification (a ‚Äúlabel‚Äù) of a psychological and/or behavioral disorder that would result  in the creation of an IEP and a BIP.

Have you ever seen an IEP that specifies service provision by the parents, i.e. attending school every day with their child? I think it‚Äôs far more likely that the child was experiencing and witnessing violence in the home and his parents were doing everything in their power to conceal that fact. School administrators were astonishingly negligent as well, that‚Äôs certainly clear.

I fully recognize how untenable, agonizing, and dangerous the current situation is for SPED teachers in districts across the country, but I really hate to see this example cited over and over when we do not even know if the student was receiving SPED services. In fact, it very much sounds like he remained in his regular classroom all day, much to the detriment of those around him.

I don‚Äôt have any good answers, nor do I think there can be a blanket solution that works for every teacher and every student with a disability. What I do fear is this particular school shooting being used to swing the pendulum back to the days of warehousing, isolating, abusing, and restraining disabled children. 

Fix gun laws, destroy as many illegal weapons as we can get our hands on, listen to teachers, and hold administrators accountable. To date, the principal of the school where this teacher was shot remains employed by the district. His parents have not been arrested or charged. The system is working for them.

The solution needs to begin with an acknowledgment of responsibility by all the adults charged with protecting students and teachers, followed by genuine accountability, financial and legal.

He's incredibly misogynistic because of how he's raised at home- he walks all over his mother and does whatever he wants to her and the only person he listens to is his father which then translates to only listening to the 2 male admin workers in the office at school which leads me to 4. He's incredibly manipulative - I know he can't help some of the things he says and does due to his autism but some of the things he does he most definitely can help and chooses to do. He refuses to do schoolwork 95% of the week and to avoid it, he throws fits, breaks things, hurts us, or hurts himself to stall until oh class time is over and now it's time for your hourly break again. Basically he gets rewarded for behaving that way because he knows he'll eventually get his break aka time on his iPad which he just watched videos and does whatever he wants for 15 minutes every hour to calm him down and prepare for the next activity. Now the reason I say he's being manipulative is because he literally will behave perfectly fine until I say ""okay buddy 5 more minutes on the iPad then we have to work on science"" or whatever the subject is and the SECOND the timer goes off for me to take the iPad away and start working, he jumps into the behavior: trying to run out the door of the classroom and then even the door of the school, pushing me into walls, going behind the teacher's desk and breaking things and ripping up paper, grabbing my clothes and throwing me around, choking me, hitting me, punching me, etc. so I call for help on the radio and guess who shows up? The vice principal who he happens to LOVE so of course when he shows up, the kid does this evil smile and immediately pretends like he wasn't acting up. He WANTS the VP to show up because he adores him. He doesn't want to upset him so when he sees him because he knows we'll have to call him if we can't control him by ourselves (me and the other 2 female SPED teachers who work with him, even though he's supposed to be on a gen Ed track he needs 24/7 supervision and it sometimes takes 5 yes 5 adults to transfer him from one classroom to another). He ONLY listens to the male admins (principal and vice principal). Even when us female teachers say ""STOP! You're hurting me!"" He LAUGHS. he KNOWS what he's doing. He KNOWS he's going to get out of doing his work and eventually get what he wants aka iPad time and no schoolwork. We've called home multiple times and another student got suspended for doing the same stuff but the school is so scared of his parents because they've threatened to sue us because of their own child literally attacking us, nobody wants to stand up to the parents or advocate for us. So basically me and the other 2 female teachers I work with are forced to get abused every single day and we all want to leave so badly but we don't want to abandon each other and make things worse by being even more understaffed than we already are. I literally cry in the bathroom during my lunch break nearly every day. I love my kiddos but this specific kid is making me question if I even want to come back next school year. I really can't do this anymore and have no support from anyone.",pressedpower,2023-02-18,Ireland

Doing this properly would require more funding, more sped teachers, more peas and associates. I think often times districts are using the idea of integration and inclusion to justify cutting spEd staff and resources. They commit to mainstreaming students, without mainstreaming their supports. They disguise it as this great plan to be more inclusive and forward thinking by trying to eliminate the ‚Äúneed‚Äù for teachers in self contained spaces. From the outside it seems like a lovely, forward thinking idea.

I would say 6 out of 8 of my caseload have intense behaviors because of traumas. They have mood swings, get triggered, lack empathy, etc because of their caretakers and environment they live in. It‚Äôs hard because some are still in an unstable home. 

These kids are not lost causes. They can heal and they have the ability to grow and recover from their childhood trauma. I have cPTSD myself and know you can have a good life after trauma. 

I worked as a behavior therapist for 3 years before becoming an SLC teacher. I‚Äôm not sure how other schools are, but I think my school handles behaviors correctly. I have the freedom to give out disciplinary actions such as suspending a student if I deem it necessary. I also have a lot of skills in being able to give out appropriate consequences for my students as well. I‚Äôve been able to have a student join a different grade band for recesses when they were starting conflict with their grade band peers for a week as a consequence. I appreciate the flexibility and trust from my administration that I‚Äôm making the best decision in those tricky situations. 

HOWEVER, I also have worked on a reservation where just about every child has a lot of trauma and they‚Äôre dealing with intense generational trauma. The admin was not prepared. They did not know how to discipline and hold students accountable. We did do a lot of trauma informed training and that did help, but not when it came to giving out consequences.

No it isn't. You don't have to currently be able to perform the sport to be a great teacher at it. Every single record holder or an Olympic medalist in any sport had a trainer that was at that time weaker than them. It didn't stop them being a coach that produced the best in the world.

maintaining fitness requires actively working for it, doesn't have anything to do with knowledge. now, if that person was peddling some bs ""i can't..."" then yeah, id agree theyd have no place teaching. but that isnt most. 

plenty of athletes, competitors etc do not maintain after they retire. especially in coaching/teaching roles. some do but it doesnt say much about knowledge.

However, they are coaches.  They know sports, and CPR.  That is all they need to be qualified for the job really.  Keep in mind, many are not young.  There's high school coaches in their 80s.  My uncle is one, refuses to retire, still coaching baseball.  But despite his age, he'll show the kids how it is done.  He was coaching basketball back in his 50's, I was a freshman, and practiced with the varsity for something to do.  I recall a couple of the players didn't want to go along with flopping their wrist when taking shots.  Something lame about it looking gay.  I'm not kidding, that's what they said.  Anyway, to demonstrate the method properly, uncle took a shot at half court, and made it.  Then grabbed another ball, faced the other basket, and swished it.

Although, I have another relative who tried being a personal trainer, and can't figure out why she can't keep clients.  I think it is because she's over 300 lbs, and can't run 100' to save her life.  I wouldn't work with her.",Goalie_deacon,2021-03-16,Ireland

And my other teacher was fairly jacked, only slightly getting a dad bod. With his wife being ""obese"". But she just had a set of kids and was working off the weight again. Which makes sense.

There was one PE teacher that wouldn't fuck around though. Kids would often complain and say he's asking them to do too much, and that he couldn't do it. So he did everything he told them to do. He would do the suicides, he would do the push-ups, sit-ups, he would do the runs, and would do the weightlifting. He did it so the kids would know he isn't someone who is fat and doesn't know anything about actual health or physical exertion. Which garnered some respect from kids and others were annoyed.

I just wish I wasn't so insecure when I went to highschool.. And elementary school. I always felt people would mock the way I would run, so I wouldn't run as much.

I also know that being allowed on the sportsball team is the one and only motivation for a lot of our kids to even try to keep their grades up (hats off to our coaches and athletic director, who will not hesitate to throw a star player off a team for failing classes or getting into disciplinary trouble - who understand that academics is the point and sportsball is the reward).

I'm not consistent with it, but I do try to celebrate the sportsball - occasionally see a game and congratulate some random student on something they did.  They SHOULD care about academics for learnings' sake, or barring that, for the grade, or barring that, because their parents care about their schooling and they don't want to get in trouble.  But I know for a lot of our kids, none of these things are in place, and the only reason they're not flunking everything is because their coach would kick them off the team if they did, so they occasionally try in class and occasionally aren't obnoxious in class.

As a middle school teacher, I see each of my kids in my classroom roughly 5.5-6 hours for per week *if it‚Äôs a full 5-day week* with no scheduled days off or unexpected absences for them, which is only 3% of their time (and mine) all week.

I am right there with you, generally. In my school, most of the athletes were assholes with giant egos (and bullies to boot). I was also an athlete--rode motocross, snowboarded, and skateboarded. Got told none of those were real sports. Nobody ever gave a shit if I did them or not. Nobody came to watch me. 

Now, I prioritize supporting nontraditional students. I try to help out kids by starting clubs/doing stuff for the ones who have nothing to do. I figure the traditional athletes already have dozens of people literally cheering for them; they can handle it if I don't show up. 

BUT

Being a teacher has given me a lot more respect for student athletes. Many of them are kind, hardworking, intelligent kids who balance going to school with practicing nightly. Also, many of them are under insane pressure from parents/others. WE may not care about sports, but almost everyone else does to an insane degree, and the SAs feel that. 

So yeah, maybe we can still not care for traditional sports much, and that's fine. At the same time, I do go to a few games per year here and there, and I will banter with kids about sports, running, etc. to show common interests. It's not so much that you have to care about sports--just don't be a dick about it and you're good. Keep an open mind.",justridingbikes099,2023-03-08,Ireland

First from a teacher/employee lens. I feel there is nothing that should be ""mandated to attend"" outside of your work hours. If it's during work hours and they are willing to alter schedules so people can attend, then that is fine IMO. But other than that, you cannot tell me I have to go do something on my own time without being compensated, especially if it's something I dread and won't enjoy. I work in NYC and being we have a great union here this is actually not allowed contractually. No administrator can force us to attend an event outside our work day without compensation, and even with compensation they cannot force attendance. 

From a lifelong athlete/coach lens.  You can take people (especially young people) from completely different races, ethnic backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, religions, intelligence levels, and have them work together as a team on this one thing. It also instills responsibility, teamwork, work ethic, and motivation in many young people. Now as far for people just watching and for the participants, sports creates a sense of camaraderie that your rarely find in other things. It is a sense of belonging to a group that all support the same thing. In a school it can help create great school spirit and get students engaged in a way that they otherwise wouldn't be (every homecoming needs a homecoming committee to help plan it). 

Lastly I'll add that I get referencing it as ""sportsball"" may seem funny or sarcastic but honestly to me it's a very naive way of looking at things and looking down on something you just may not understand. Think about other things our students may be interested in (especially the students that don't fit in, the misfits, the ""nerds"", etc), would you mock those interests. Because the term is a way to mock these things and kind of indicate ""oh this is just physical competition which is brainless"". And if that's the case just look up a football playbook and see what needs to be memorized and understood by players just to execute a play. And I'll end with this, certain college and professional ""sportsball"" events can generate a live audience at a stadium or arena that can range from 1,000 people to over 100,000 in attendance. The world cup final this year which was a match of France vs. Argentina was watched LIVE by 1.5 BILLION people globally. Basically 1 out of every 5 people ON EARTH were watching. Can you think of anything else that comes remotely close to unifying the planet like this ""sportsball"" event?",ManyRanger4,2023-03-08,Ireland

Liking things is also contagious. Just because you may not like the event doesn‚Äôt mean you might not like something g you see at it. People watch. Who had the most school spirit?  Who went to the game to just hang out and talk with friends because it‚Äôs the place to be? Your students will see you there and that‚Äôs another connection point.

Basketball game, volleyball game, track meet, school play, choir concert, etc. if a kid tells me he has a job at McDonald‚Äôs, I ask when he normally works, then when it‚Äôs convenient I stop by and get some fries (I hate McDonald‚Äôs). It‚Äôs eye opening to see a kid who works hard at McDonald‚Äôs or at track when they won‚Äôt work hard at Social Studies or English. Is there something there that I can use to convince a kid to do more in my class?  Sometimes the answer is yes. 

I just recently saw a kid (who does junior MMA on the weekends) win his first match.

Teachers should take an interest in sports teams for the same reason they should be interested in school test scores, school music and theater performances, school art displays, school community service endeavors, and a dozen other non-academic things I am leaving out.

You know that for some kids, sports is the only thing getting them in the door, right? For some, it's the only thing getting them to take interest in their classes as well. It's not just exercise, it's learning to work with others, learning to communicate effectively in immediate and long-term situations, it's learning new and unexpected roles, it's learning to subjugate your own ego to contribute to a greater collective goal.

I have learned that I have that ""Northeast privilege,"" teaching in a part of the country that values teachers more than most and that places an appropriate emphasis on sports - our coaches make a few grand in their stipend, not six figure full time salaries. I'm sorry that there are places where sports rule the roost, where I guess beefy dudes in letter jackets are shoving bespectacled future software engineers into lockers or something, and where weekly pep rallies interrupt the academic goings on to support 'sportsball' teams but I can't imagine that is the norm and not the exception.",BillG2330,2023-03-08,Ireland

If you don't care about the sports your students play, why should they care about the class you teach?  One of my students is on the soccer team and they won the city championships.  That's awesome. I wish my school would at least acknowledge that, they don't. Now, our school is different, since it is one of many, and the ""school"" team students play for it is actually the ""building"" team.

If anything, you should at least have a bit of ""esprit d'corps"" for the school, this could be a unifying experience, and go out and support the students who do care so much, as well as fellow staff who are putting in the extra work.",bkrugby78,2023-03-08,Ireland

And I say this as a grade-A certified nerd who was in the marching band all through high school.

Sometimes I think we place too much weight on sports in schools, however, for the students it  could be very meaningful to see a big showing of support from faculty and other students.

We have a tradition (not unique to our school) where senior football players ask teachers to wear their away jersey to the homecoming game. I usually have about a million things I'd rather be doing that night, but when a senior has asked me I always try to make sure I can go. It's a big deal for them, because they're usually asking you because you're one of their favorite teachers.

So yeah, I think some schools can be a little ridiculous when it comes to sports, and maybe tacking on an additional day to the year falls under that category, but to be dismissive of students' interests with the ""sportsball"" comments is immature and lame of you.",InDenialOfMyDenial,2023-03-08,Ireland

True, I didn‚Äôt graduate from some small Christian college. I chose to go to a real, accredited university whose degrees are respected nationwide. I realize in history there is a movement known as ‚Äúpresenting‚Äù.  This is where a person or event is judged by the standards and morality of today, not by the time in which it happened. An excellent example of this can be seen in the removal of the Theodore Roosevelt statue from the museum in New York due to his perceived racism and classism. When viewed by today‚Äôs standards it is true. By the standards of the late 19th century it is false. A patriotism class will not be needed to teach us teachers this.  I think I just did a pretty good job of it in just a few lines. Teachers an now make up their own personal ideas on ‚Äúpresenting‚Äù.  Simply write ‚Äúpresenting‚Äù out of the state standards of education (or whatever they are called in Oklahoma) and move on.

My thought is that if this is on school devices, then 30 or so licenses are a reusable investment, especially if you buy the licenses in a sale, which I assume will be more likely as the KSP2 release date approaches...

Another thought:  can you install 30instances of KSP on a school drive somewhere that the students can access via their own devices when the need to build stuff in KSP?  That approach has some challenges and may be a terrible idea ... but perhaps someone in your IT team can figure a solution.

From what I know about how KSP works/is installed, the ""installation"" aspect of the suggestion above would be trivial, but the access and play part would be the challenge from a network/internet-quality/fps and security perspective.",TheWombleOfDoom,2022-11-21,Ireland

Less motivated, more distracted, more aggressive and antagonistic, don't value education, etc. What can schools do to help overcome these issues (usually developed at home) present in so many kids?","I have a few responses, as a public school teacher and a conservative. For some background, I teach in rural Central California and have taught at a couple different schools, one of which was in an extremely poor agricultural town with a huge gang and drug problem. The other is much more middle-class, although it has some of the same issues as the other school.

I would *also* say that my experience, especially at my current school but also at my previous one, is pretty far from the dystopian nightmares that schools are portrayed as by many on both the left and the right. The vast majority of people are pretty normal, really.

First of all, you‚Äôre right to say we can‚Äôt control what goes on outside our own classrooms. And yet you say later that ‚Äúkids should have a better home life‚Äù isn‚Äôt a good answer. This reminds me of one of the binds that an administrator once put us in: her motto was ‚Äúnever bring up a problem unless you‚Äôre offering a solution.‚Äù I understand why she wanted to avoid a lengthy session of people complaining. But I thought it was flawed nonetheless: sometimes an ad hoc solution you come up with to satisfy a requirement is not good. Sometimes you need to thoroughly discuss a problem before any solutions come to mind. So acknowledging that most of these problems *are* the result of bad parenting is useful even if it doesn‚Äôt bring us a solution. At very least it allows the teacher to understand the limits of what he or she can do. The best teacher in the world couldn‚Äôt necessarily overcome a poor home life (although it is possible, it isn‚Äôt a guarantee.)

I‚Äôve been teaching for fifteen years and I wouldn‚Äôt say these problems have gotten worse exactly. That depends a lot on the school, but I wouldn‚Äôt say that violence, bullying, racism, foul language, or disrespect for teachers have increased. In my own career they have maintained at just about the same ‚Äúunacceptably high but still nowhere close to a majority‚Äù level.

I agree for the most part on the discipline issue. On the one hand, I think schools should be cautious about this: we often don‚Äôt see a whole picture and can rush to judgement. On the other hand, the presumption (seeming to come from higher up within the state bureaucracy) that imposing penalties is itself a failure seems wrong to me. Schools in California lose points on their ‚Äúreport card‚Äù for suspensions, but I think it needs to be looked at in context. If your other metrics are good, maybe it‚Äôs in part *because* of the culture of self-discipline you‚Äôve created.

As for parents, I guess anyone can have a child. So you‚Äôre going to get all kinds of people as parents. I would also say that a large number of people will always attempt to deflect from their own responsibility. So if their own child is misbehaving, it‚Äôs because of the unfair teacher, or the other classmates, or whatever. Many times a parent has told me to make sure her child isn‚Äôt sitting next to a particular student. But in reality, that other student isn‚Äôt doing anything wrong: he‚Äôs the scapegoat that the kid has used and now the parents believe it.

I share your concern about alternate forms of education, while nonetheless supporting them. I‚Äôm perfectly happy for private schools and homeschooling to exist, and am not *opposed* to charter schools although I find them to be a bit more of a grey area. The truth is most parents can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt homeschool or pay for a private school. I probably will, when I have children, not because I hate the public schools but because I think we could go farther and deeper at the elementary level in a home education setting. But most parents will never do anything but send their children to the basic, regular public school. So making those schools as good as possible is a priority.

As I keep rambling, the thing that occurs to me is that while we can‚Äôt replicate stability in a home life, we can give the students stability at school. Chasing after educational fads and allowing a high rate of teacher burnout and turnover adds more instability to the students‚Äô lives. Keeping things mostly predictable and solid (I might even say ‚Äúconservative‚Äù though I don‚Äôt mean it exactly in a political sense) will add some stability. Some of the students I know who have very unstable home lives are the ones who love school the most: it gives them a place where there‚Äôs relative physical safety and predictability of routines. It‚Äôs not perfect, but for some kids it‚Äôs important. I think a lot of the time administrators who think they can find a magic fix that will solve everything accidentally take away from that sense of predictability and order that schools can provide.",OptatusCleary,2023-04-01,Ireland

So, obviously, we need to work to change the culture. But beyond that, can anything be done?

I say YES. I have a specific actionable item. Here it is:

**Ban student cellphones on school campuses.**

It's funny, when I was in school we were not allowed to bring electronic video game devices to school. But now kids can. And why? Just because those devices can also be used to make phone calls?!

Would this solve everything? Certainly not. But it could help.

But guess what? There's a massive constituency out there against that. Is it teachers? No. Is it administrators? No. Surprise, surprise, it's... parents! Yes, parents don't want that. (""I *must* be able to get ahold of little Johnny at all times!"") And parents elect school board members who in turn select the superintendent who in turn sets policy. So good luck with that!

But seriously, I wish schools would push back more on parents on this issue. The constant distraction and drive for more dopamine makes it difficult for a lot of kids to focus on any of the learning tasks at hand.

That's just one thought. But overall, schools can't fix culture. You're not alone in noticing this. My wife is a teacher and she and her colleagues have noticed the same thing. This bunch of kids is fundamentally different than all the bunches that came before in that last 20-30 years. That's saying something!

Schools cannot control what happens off campus, we can only control the procedures and policies on school grounds.

I know it's not going to be a popular answer, but the problem is parents who think that discipline is child abuse. I'm not even talking about physical discipline, just any attempts to set and enforce boundaries for their children.

This is the cause of #5, which seems to be the root cause of all the other problems: we as a society have come to believe *that people are not responsible for the consequences* of their actions. If this is the attitude of the parents, *it will pass onto the children*. That's what you're seeing now in the classroom.

Social programs aren't a solution to this issue, they're one of the root causes: we've subsidised being idle, single parenthood, and being irresponsible with debt. With each of these subsidies, we have instilled in people that they *are not responsible* for their own bad decisionmaking.

On the other hand, we've told everyone that the best way to get ahead in life is to be lucky or privileged. If you fail, you're a victim. *If this is the mentality that children have -- that everything they do is irrelevant because they're limited by their race, gender and social status -- what incentive do they have to try?*

How would I address this at school? I have no idea. You can't use the stick (#5) because the parents don't believe in consequences, so you have to find the carrot. In the past, that was the American dream: if you work hard at school, get married, and get a job you'll live a prosperous life.",fatmattuk,2023-04-01,Ireland

That's the parent's job.  Your job is simply to make students smarter, not make them be good students.  You can, perhaps, light a spark in an otherwise dull student, and that's a fantastic thing, but that's above and beyond your responsibility.

Nearly every issue you describe can be solved by effective parenting.  In the absence of that, separating those with good parenting from those who can't be bothered is absolutely essential.  My school district had an ""alternative school"".  If you screwed up bad enough, you went there.  You were still taught all the same curriculum, but you had significantly less freedom, and significantly tougher adult figures there.  Assaults on teachers resulted in immediate arrest by SROs and transport to juvenile detention centers.  Two consecutive semesters of unsatisfactory participation resulted in expulsion from the school system.  Expulsion meant your parents now had to be responsible for you, and for me at least, there was great motivation to make me shape up and not get expelled.  Mind you, I was one of those kids, I was expelled, and I ended up being homeschooled for a few years until the school board allowed me to return to public school.  The point being, there needs to be zero tolerance on these things.

>Kids unmotivated to work, unresponsive to prompting

Fail them.  There is a standard to meet, if the child doesn't meet it, then they don't proceed.  No child left behind began the gutting of the power schools had at ensuring students participated.  I know this isn't a you thing, I'm talking societally, we need to accept that failing is sometimes the best thing you can do for a kid, and we seem to have forgotten that somehow.

>Parents either uninvolved entirely or believe it's ""the school's problem to take care of it.""

It'll quickly become their problem when you expel them.  Beyond that, this is a much bigger societal problem to fix, but in my opinion, liberal philosophies aren't going to succeed in fixing it.   The simple answer is parents don't *have* to be involved, so they aren't.  The birds and the bees used to be a parents only thing.  Parents had to step up and have those discussions.  Now, people want to offload that to you, the teacher.  It's suddenly your job to teach those things.  And you better do it right, or else.  That's absurd.  Your job is to teach them math.  The parent's job is to teach them how to be a decent human, and how to survive at life.  Society's willingness to offload the responsibility of parenting to teachers leads to this, they're directly related.

>Grades, citizenship, rewards ineffective in improving behavior or academics

I read this as ""teachers unable to fully supplant parents"".  Not to be a broken record, but you as a teacher can never fix bad parenting.  Your only hope is that a child will wake up and have a eureka moment of.maturity, and realize they have to change despite their parents.  Otherwise, their behavior will be reinforced and endorsed by their role models, and you won't be able to supplant that in the limited exposure you have with them.

>Nonstop cycles of ""do nothing in class, missing work, turned in late""

Same as above.  You're not in a position to functionally change these behaviors.

>Meaningful punishments (making kids picking up trash, holding after school/during lunch, other forms of labor or consequence) have effectively been stripped away, thanks to sue-happy parents helping create laws that tie our hands from any meaningful consequence

I had the benefit of growing up in both a very liberal area, then moving and finishing growing up in a very conservative area.  Guess which one of these areas was a problem in the ways you describe?  The sue-happy parents were always liberals, in my experience.  On the flip side, I did 340 squat-thrusts in one block, and got 10 paddles that afternoon, all before I went home and got a whooping from my dad in the conservative area.  For the record, I support giving you the freedom to punish as you see fit, barring physical contact of course, and if I don't like it I should be able to withdraw my child from school.  Simple as that.

>Fights, bullying, antagonizing, on a daily basis, on grounds of things like socioeconomic background, LGBTQ, racism, in addition to usual ""boys causing trouble"" and ""girl drama"".

Bad parenting, and school administration allowing it to occur.  Fights specifically should not be a thing.  Immediate expulsion from conventional school, and assignment to alternative school for remainder of current semester and one additional one.  Done.  Zero tolerance.

>Rampant racist, sexist, homophobic, etc language, loudly, repeatedly, and shamelessly spouted in classes, halls, during lunch, PE, everywhere, every day.

Reprimand, Second Reprimand, ISS, OSS, then expulsion.  Done.

>A clear and growing disrespect for staff and fellow students by a sizeable portion of student body. It's no longer ""a small handful"" of kids. It's ""a quarter or more of every class.""

Depends greatly on the instance.  Verbal abuse should result in the reprimand to expulsion path.  Physical abuse should result in immediate assignment to alternative school.

>Clear disrespect for school property, vandalism, destruction of school items, desks and bathrooms mostly, but also inappropriate words/drawings on walls, doors, desks, etc.

Same as above.

>while simultaneously not providing any solution for those ""bad"" kids

You aren't going to be able to fix everyone.  There are some kids who just aren't going to see the light.  The best you can do is to force the parents hand, and hope the kids get it.  In the meantime, it's not worth the negative effects on the kids who are doing the right thing, nor the negative effect on your own mental health and wellbeing.  You ought to know better than anyone that the path we are on isn't sustainable.  Accountability needs to be administered, and it's not you that should bear the burden.

>So assuming there isn't a magic utopia where you could just lock away and hide from all the ""bad kids"", what could schools do to help make campus better for all kids?

This isn't possible.  Segregation isn't permanent though.  The idea is that sending the bad kids away encourages them to change.  If they don't, nothing you do is going to help them.",ValiantBear,2023-04-02,Ireland

For a lot of teachers this is a lot of money.

‚ÄúThose new standards are now being taught to thousands of teachers across the state during 10 voluntary three-day conferences where teachers also get a $700 stipend for attending and the possibility of a $3,000 bonus.‚Äù

The push to get rid of actual educators and qualified teachers is clearly part of the plan. It‚Äôs why DeSantis is always attacking teachers. It‚Äôs why he‚Äôs one of the most popular conservative leaders right now, he‚Äôs a culture war politician attacking the people they want attacked. Pair that along with the push to hire ex cops and veterans to teach, they know the worse the education, the more likely for future conservative voters. 

Floridas government is quite literally pushing for christian views and downplaying American atrocities. A different related article talking about this video

‚ÄúIn one of the slides presented and shared with News4JAX, the DOE (department of education in Florida) said it was a ‚Äúmisconception‚Äù that the Founding Fathers wanted a strict separation of church and state.
‚ÄúThe presenters said that it was because [Thomas] Jefferson when he said ‚Äòwall of separation between church and state,‚Äô he didn‚Äôt mean it,‚Äù Vogel said.

Vogel, who teaches academic research, said presenters also promoted the idea of ‚Äúoriginalism‚Äù ‚Äî the theory that the Constitution should be given the original meaning it had when it became law ‚Äî by repeatedly using the phrase ‚Äúthrough the founders‚Äô eyes.‚Äù

Vogel said the presentation also downplayed slavery by noting that two-thirds of the Founding Fathers owned slaves but added, ‚Äúeven those that held slaves did not defend the institution.‚Äù Presenters also showed a slide that said less than 4% of slavery in the Western Hemisphere was in Colonial America, which Vogel interpreted to mean ‚Äúeverybody was doing it.‚Äù

Tampa Bay Times reported the workshops were developed with the help of Hillsdale College, a private conservative liberal arts college in Michigan, and the Bill of Rights Institute, which was founded by Charles Koch, an influential billionaire‚Äù

In America, private schools have far fewer resources and experience dealing with kids who need supports than public schools do.

> AMANDA, I NEED YOU TO KNOW HOW PROUD OF YOU I AM - Fellow disabled person on the internet who has had me share of ableist abuse and refuses to take it.

> Your child was absolutely not in his wrong for standing up to an adult male authority figure who was using physically threatening posturing to force compliance.. AFTER he ignored his LEGAL OBLIGATION TO UPHOLD HER MEDICALLY NECESSARY ACCOMMODATIONS.

> This teacher is the one who needs disciplined.

> He is unfit to perform the duties of his job.

> Your child was forced to act as an adult advocate when she was stripped of her right to accommodations. She stood up to physically aggressive posturing and verbal threats. She first made her medical accommodation needs clear, and he ignored her. Then he escalated. And he continued to escalate the situation.

> WHY IN THE FUCK DID THE SCHOOL NOT PROVIDE HIM WITH THE CLASS ROSTER SO HE WOULD ALREADY HAVE THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO PERFORM THE DUTIES OF HIS JOB?!

> WHY IN THE FUCK IS A LITTLE GIRL MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING HER MEDICAL ACCOMMODATION AT SCHOOL?

> No no no no no NO. There are instances in which telling someone to fuck off. Repeatedly. Is necessary. This is one of those instances.

> This needs to be escalated, immediately. Because your child should NEVER EVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES been put in a position where she was forced to stand up to ableist abuse and threatening behaviour from a staff member. Your kid got forced into a corner, and they fought their way out. This is one of those instances where punishing her teachers her to accept abuse, and that she's not allowed to self advocate or stand up to someone's threats.

> Anyone saying you're being ""one of those parents"" is an ableist pile of waste. You are NTA and neither is your kid. I'm fucking proud of her. And I'm here to tell the gym teacher, and every staff member who made this mess to fuck off right along with her.

And follow up comment:

> Furthermore, the child who lied to the instructor and was the catalyst for this shitshow needs to be disciplined.

> That they find your child's response to having her basic medical needs violated, and then threatened by a grown ass man who felt the need to take a physically aggressive posture against a disabled child. I'm saying that again; his standing over her while he threatened her with discipline, and used his body language to be visibly overpowering is PHYSICALLY AGGRESSIVE. Inappropriate. Inappropriate. That they can find this in any way an inappropriate response to a grown ass man being physically aggressive to coerce compliance is beyond the pale.

> But the child who LIED and set this in motion is, what? Just being a kid? Joking? Harharhar! It's hilarious to abuse disabled people! This child needs disciplined. The staff need disciplined, from front office to the gym teacher, and they need some serious training. They want to punish her, but what they should be afraid of right now is the legal hellscape they are entering if they do.

> How in the FUCK do you expect someone to respond to a person placed in authority over them, abusing them?!

> Your kid just showed everyone what type of man he is. And he is not fit to work with people, let alone children.

> Seriously, give that child a good hug. I'm sending many her way, because this isn't the first, nor the last time she'll be forced to advocate in an ENTIRELY NECESSARY way. And if the ableds would just stop abusing us, and listen, maybe we wouldn't NEED to tell them to fuck off.

> You've done something very right if her response to ableist violence was to repeatedly tell them to fuck off. She solidly stood her ground and that takes fucking gumption! I wish I'd had her boldness when I was a little girl and no one was there to stand up for me.

They never tell you when your classes have kids with IEPs.

They're not perfect, but here you see a perfect example of how private schools market themselves--by kicking out all the children they don't want because they're too much trouble or not making them look good, they then tell unwitting prospective parents that they perform so well and the local schools are so uncool. A kid who is reasonably good in school and reasonably has their shit together will do just fine in either environment and get into a good enough college, so you're spending a lot of money to make sure your kid has rich friends. If your kid has any sort of learning challenge, you may very well end up just like this family. It sounds like her kid was kind of over the school because she wasn't crying bitterly over losing all her friends--which can happen especially as kids get older. 

I do know one person who benefited from private school. It was because she went to a large high school with laissez faire policies and she was cutting class left and right and falling through the cracks. The private high school was smaller and it was what she needed. There was a still a downside, however, as she wasn't able to finish all of the math and science curriculum she was ready for since the school was too small to provide it and she ended up having to make up for lost time (and take a lot of extra, expensive credits) in college. 

Also if you're wealthy enough to pay private schools out of pocket, your local public schools are probably high academic performing as well, which is the other ridiculous irony of it all.

Younger grades of gradeschool (k-4) - basically team sports non-stop.  The teacher did come up with some interesting variations when he could tell we were getting bored of dodgeball or something, but the vast majority of activities were team sports like soccer or basketball.

Older grades of gradeschool (5-8) - same as the above; less of the silly games like dodgeball, more serious/real sports.  Also around the time the teacher had a solid 3-4 weeks of track and field related activities.

Gradeschool in general - at least a couple times a month the teacher wouldn't have anything special planned, and we'd end up doing stretches for the whole class or have it be a free gym kind of thing where we could do our own thing as long as it involved a ball of some kind (soccer or basketball usually), or running around.  

Highschool - somewhat dependent on the year of student.  Freshman/9th graders couldn't drive, and most Sophomores/10th graders didn't have their license yet but were learning to drive.  The teachers had some interesting takes on what PE was - with table tennis, bowling, and archery being on the curriculum at different times.  Older classes (Juniors and Seniors) would likely have a drive available in my area, and that meant they could go down to the golf course & driving range that was farther away than the bowling alley in walking distance.  At least a couple weeks of highschool PE involved weight training/lifting weights.  At some point, the more progressive PE teacher even had a week of meditation tapes where we simply sat on mats and listened to a nearly hypnotic voice telling us to just relax, with white noise of waves on a beach in the background (yeah not really physical activity, but we weren't going to argue with glorified nap time).

Highschool in general - yes, there were still team sports involved, but it tended to use those as a stop-gap between other parts of the curriculum; a spare day or two to mix things up instead of non-stop table tennis, or because we just weren't going to go down to the bowling alley literally every day.  PE in highschool was more memorable for the activities we *didn't* already do hundreds of times before in gradeschool.

;;

Amount of study --

Gradeschool was virtually no study involved; and as long as you participated we were pretty much guaranteed an A.

Highschool, the study depended on what the non-team-sport activity was; we did have the world's saddest excuse for tests like a 10 question multiple choice on what various rules of table tennis were, or given 3 diagrams to answer what each split was in bowling.

Nutrition tended to be reserved for the separate health class; PE may have mentioned it, but was more about the actual activity more than it was learning the difference between carbs and fats, sugar and protein.

There was virtually never homework for PE.

;;

Is it compulsory --

For the most part yes, but it's kind of a soft yes.

As in, we would need a doctors note (and a very obvious leg or arm in a cast) to get out of participating.  The only other thing that could get you out of PE was a parent's note excusing you from doing it.

The alternative would usually imply you were being a big enough moody brat that you'd be sent to the principle's office because you wouldn't play soccer - and most kids would rather play soccer than spend quality time with the principle.

The very few times I ever saw someone talk their way out of participating, it was because of other circumstances - the teachers were *usually* sensitive enough if a kid had just lost their grandparents or something and not argue with a kid who just didn't want to play soccer, but it usually meant it had to be a damn good reason than just ""I don't wanna.""  That kind of excuse would only really work in pre-K or kindergarten, where again, the teacher would likely know to pick their battles and not argue with a fussy 4-5 year old having a bad day.",Fenriradra,2022-03-06,Ireland

It rarely gets into actually weight lift, but a lot of running, swimming, aerobic exercises, sometimes even stuff like yoga or martial arts, with often having a week or two blocks where the goal might be to improve your mile time running by the end, or some other basic task.

On top of this, we took a fitness test every term that measured our physical progress.

In high school, my state requires two years of PE, but I did get around it by taking Summer PE twice. Summer PE is a lot more fun compared to during school. Throughout the month of June, we did a wide variety of activities on and off campus. Monday was swim day, so we'd travel to the local pool and do related activities there. Wednesday was sorta like a road trip day, where we'd go somewhere and do activities. Typically, this was to a hiking trail, but we also went canoeing as well. Friday was bowling day and we'd go to the aforementioned bowling alley. Tuesdays and Thursdays were doing various activities on campus.",TheGreat_War_Machine,2022-03-07,Ireland

We had semesters (half the year) which were divided up into PE and Health in 9th grade and PE/Health/Drivers Ed in 10th grade. So you didn't really get much PE in any year. 

The actual PE classes consisted of a variety of stuff. Some days we would go to the weight room. Other days we would go play tennis, or flag football. It mainly involved playing games. Our high school had a pool, too, which we would go and do activities in sometimes. 

(We had health class every year from 6th grade to 10th grade which mostly consisted of lectures about not having sex and also watching Super Size Me, which we watched every single year)

After 10th grade, you didn't have to take PE anymore, but they had PE classes you could sign up for if you wanted to. In 11th grade I took resistance training, which is weightlifting for the most part mixed with intense cardio. That was brutal. Our teacher was cool, but man, he loved to torment us in the weight room and out on the track. 

Other classes you could sign up for included Fitness For Life (basically a continuation of regular PE), whom we partnered up with for some exercises in resistance training. There was also aquatics, focusing mostly on the pool. I can't remember what else there was.",starrsuperfan,2022-03-07,Ireland

An investigation found that while the training didn‚Äôt explicitly contain content that broke the law, the school was still penalized and had its accreditation downgraded because the state school board felt that the training could still convey outlawed ideas.

>‚ÄúUpon reviewing this information, the OSDE did not find any evidence to substantiate the allegation that the training included ‚Äòstatements that specifically shame white people for past offenses in history, and state that all are implicitly racially biased in nature,‚Äô‚Äù Clark wrote.¬†

>However, the investigation did find that audio from the training, which Clark later declined to provide the the State Board of Education, ‚Äúincorporated‚Äù or was ‚Äúbased on‚Äù concepts including that ‚Äúsocietal systems, including public schools, were originally solely developed by the majority, who were then predominantly White, middle-class individuals,‚Äù that black students are more likely to be suspended than white students, and that ‚Äúdeeply rooted stereotypes, built over time and by history and culture, can still be found in classrooms.‚Äù  
>  
>These ideas violated House Bill 1775, a law Oklahoma enacted in 2021 that banned some teachings about race and gender in public schools, even if the concepts weren‚Äôt explicitly mentioned, Clark wrote.¬†  
>  
>‚ÄúThough there were not direct statements in the training that an individual should feel discomfort or guilt because of their race, the design and basis of the training makes it more likely than not that it incorporates and/or is based on such a concept,‚Äù the letter said.¬†  
>  
>The state board voted last week 4-2 to downgrade both Tulsa and Mustang Public Schools to ‚Äúaccredited with a warning,‚Äù a harsher punishment than was originally recommended. Mustang Public Schools, which self-reported a violation from earlier this year based on a student exercise meant to increase empathy among students, received the same punishment as Tulsa for the sake of consistency, board members said last week. There is no appeals process. ¬†

>‚ÄúThere was no violation of 1775 in the complete 18-minute audio and video that I saw and heard,‚Äù said Goodwin. ‚ÄúClark admitted there was no violation in the materials.

>  
>But Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, a co-author of HB1775, said he thinks Clark‚Äôs conclusion is fair and that violations of HB1775 don‚Äôt need to be explicit. ‚ÄúWhen a seminar talking about ‚Äòracial bias‚Äô is telling you that black people are more likely to be suspended than white people, I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs like crazy to think that somebody is going to think that you‚Äôre trying to get me to realize that (white teachers who disproportionately suspend black students) are racist,‚Äù he said.

I think it‚Äôs pretty sensible to ban teachings that tell people they should feel guilty, or ascribe blame to them for historical wrongs. However, I personally think Rep. Caldwell‚Äôs comments are very concerning. I think it‚Äôs very dangerous to ban facts that could induce guilt or imply the existence of structural racism without stating it outright.

I graduated in 2017 with my MA in PE and landed a lead teaching position in the Bronx for the DOE. Its not ideal teaching in the city and comes with many challenges however if your looking for a full time job, great salary and benefits they have many PE openings, however they are usually in high needs neighborhoods like the one I'm in. I personally don't recommend working for a catholic, private, or charter school if your goal is to teach public school. In lower NY many school districts won't look at that experience as applicable since catholic, private and charter schools are all run very different. 


My wife is a 2nd grade classroom teacher and got a job at a private school right out of grad school. She loves where she works but salary and benefits are much less than mine even though we have the same years experience  teaching. Also recently we have both been applying for jobs at top public schools in Westchester County and I have been getting many more interviews and demo lessons while she has struggled to even get an initial phone screening. 

One thing I believe is really important to think about is where you want your future to go and plan for that. I have always wanted to become an athletic director and head of PE at a public school.

1. The text does not violate the law.
2. The audio instruction matches the text.
3. The audio instruction violates the law.

Does this mean that presentation style, not substance, can violate the law? For instance, are they going to claim that the tone, inflection, cadence, and/or syllable emphasis is what really violated the law?

If so, that makes the overly-broad scope of this law even more broad. If not, then the overly-subjective nature of this law is even more subjective. Win/win if you're on an ""anti-woke"" crusade I suppose.

And can we reflect for a moment about how the board ruled on a violation without actually having or hearing the claimed evidence? They ruled based on ""trust me, I'm being honest.""

It sounds like it simply wants to swing the pendulum the other way as a weird way to overcome discrimination, which is kinda iffy, since that will create resentment instead of union, and further increase whatever gaps there are while not really diminishing groups disadvantages, since whatever it is it's rooted on, it is not matter of changing solely those, as the community needs to evolve as a whole, both the group and the larger one.",TheCosmicPopcorn,2023-03-28,Ireland

Critical theory can neither build nor improve anything. All it can do is point out problems in the current system and demand that things be better.

First, the explanation of all unequal outcomes in wealth, well being, and power is never due to individual actions or to differences in cultures or to differences in human abilities,¬† but only and strictly due to unjust social structures and systems. The only way to fix unequal outcomes for the downtrodden is through social policy, never by asking anyone to change their behavior or culture.

Second, all art, religion, philosophy, morality, law, media, politics, education and forms of the family are determined not by reason or truth but by social forces as well. Everything is determined by your class consciousness and social location. Religious doctrine, together with all politics and law are always, at bottom, a way for people to get or maintain social status, wealth, and therefore power over others.

Third, therefore, reality is at bottom nothing but power. And if that is the case, then to see reality, power must be mapped through the means of¬† ‚Äúintersectionality.‚Äù The categories are race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity (and sometimes others). If you are white, male, straight, cisgender then you have the highest amount of power. If you are none of these at all, you are the most marginalized and oppressed‚Äìand there are numerous categories in the middle. Most importantly, each category toward the powerless end of the spectrum has a greater moral authority and a greater ability to see the way truly things are. Only powerlessness and oppression brings moral high ground and true knowledge. Therefore those with more privilege must not enter into any debate‚Äîthey have no right or ability to advise the oppressed, blinded as they are by their social location. They simply must give up their power.

Fourth, the main way power is exercised is through language‚Äîthrough ‚Äúdominant discourses.‚Äù A dominant discourse is any truth-claim, whether grounded in supposed reason and science or in religion and morality. Language does not merely describe reality‚Äîit constructs or creates it.¬† Power structures mask themselves behind the language of rationality and truth. So academia hides its unjust structures behind talk of ‚Äúacademic freedom,‚Äù and corporations behind talk of ‚Äúfree enterprise,‚Äù science behind talk of ‚Äúempirical objectivity‚Äù, and religion behind talk of ‚Äúdivine truth‚Äù. All of these seeming truth-claims are really just constructed narratives designed to dominate and, as such, they must be unmasked. Reasoned debate and ‚Äúfreedom of speech‚Äù therefore is out‚Äîit only gives unjust discourses airtime. The only way to reconstruct reality in a just way is to subvert dominant discourses‚Äîand this requires control of speech.

Fifth, cultures, like persons, can be mapped through intersectionality. In one sense no culture is better in any regard from any other culture. All cultures are equally valid. But people who see their cultures as better, and judge other cultures as inferior or even people who see their own culture as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and judge other cultures as ‚Äúexotic‚Äù, are members of an oppressive culture. And oppressive cultures are (though this word is not used) inferior‚Äîand to be despised.
Finally, neither individual rights nor individual identity are primary. Traditional liberal emphasis on individual human rights (private property, free speech) is an obstacle to the radical changes society will need to undergo in order to share wealth and power.¬† And it is an illusion to think that, as an individual, you can carve out an identity in any way different or independent of others in your race, ethnicity, gender, and so on. Group identity and rights are the only real ones. Guilt is not assigned on the basis of individual actions but on the basis of group membership and social/racial status",paradigm_shifted2,2023-03-29,Ireland

Why should I reject it?,"You should reject any ideology. CRT is a tool an ideology. Do you have the expertise to separate the tool from the ideology? If not, you should reject all parts of the ideology until you have that expertise.

Using CRT to pinpoint active discrimination, or unintentional discrimination can be useful, as long as it is not the only tool in your tool bag. If you only have one tool, everything looks like the problem that tool is designed to fix. 

That plays itself out in CRT as everyone is either oppressor or oppressed.

In real life, if those are your only two categories, everyone is both. And you end up creating a patriarchal society with a caste like system based on ethnicity and all the other things that make up the diaspora of humanity. A reversed hierarchy is still a hierarchy and is really no better or worse than any other.

You would end up undoing all the great work by Martin Luther King, Jr and Mahatma Ghamdi during the last century, and you will end up with segregation and all the other ills we have spent so long fighting against.

Also, if everyone can only be oppressor or oppressed, why wouldn't everyone strive to be the oppressor? That will be the logical outcome of that false dichotomy.

Essentially, CRT takes a multivariant problem set and tries to do calculus to reduce it to a simpler problem set. That doesn't really capture the nuance of reality, and it doesn't allow for progress for a better society.",BillDStrong,2023-03-29,Ireland

You have to recognize that while a dash of critical theory could be ethical, to pretend we don't live in a universe of competency hierarchies is simply a fairytale.",beardsauce,2023-03-28,Ireland

A convenient lie. It's true that nobody knows everything about history, but it stops nobody from recording their observation. If a bit of history has been recorded, and you don't read it, that's on you. The convenient lie doesn't jive.

To your question. Why should you reject it? Wrong question. Critical Theory is not a natural curriculum. Meaning, it's not devised from observation and measurement of natural phenomenon. It's not science, it's philosophy. The right question then is, why should you teach\* it? Burden is on you.

\*That's the right question by the implication that you're a teacher being trained in it, therefore it's reasonable to expect that you will teach it in turn. Furthermore, it's the right question because when asked about anything else, we can find the appropriate answer promptly. Why should I teach math? Because math is a convention we use in everything. For example.

Ad hoc suggestion. You will teach social studies. Learn the Melian Dialogue, see how it relates to our current society, on various levels. Learn the dominance hierarchy, see how it relates to the Melian Dialogue. Learn democracy and tyranny, see how it relates to dominance hierarchy, the Melian Dialogue, and how dominance hierarchy converts to competence hierarchy in humans (and reconverts back).",MartinLevac,2023-03-28,Ireland

The story we participate in (christian values) is that we are all flawed but can always ask forgiveness for our mistakes and do better. We should align ourselves toward love and truth, accept the suffering we have to endure help reduce it for us and others, and see others as individual with their flaws and quality but intrinsic value (soul).

Critical theory instead say that we are part of groups (oppressed and oppressor) and that we should be judged as what group we are part of. It‚Äôs a replay of the Marxist theory. While there is some truth to that claim, everywhere this story has been played it created worse condition, more exclusion, famine, genocide. It will take our natural tribal instinct and crank it up until something break.

If you go in that direction you start treating people differently by a selected few characteristics (race, gender, sexual orientation) the result is inevitably a fight between the groups where individual reject their responsibility because they act as a group.

There's also *Theory's Empire: An Anthology of Dissent*, which is just what it sounds like, an anthology of articles from various English professors taking issue with Critical Theory and its dominance in academia.",AcroyearOfSPartak,2023-03-29,Ireland

Why should I reject it?,"Critical Theories focus on a univariate (or a very small set of variables) lens through which all forms of disparity are explained as a consequence of oppression along that single variable (or very small set of variables). As a consequence, while Critical Theories may indeed identify relevant problems in society, they rarely if ever come up with the correct conclusion with regards to the causes of that problem, and more often than not provide a solution that will more likely cause an adverse rather than the intended effect.

Many are even explicit in that regard. Kendi for example claims that whenever he sees racial disparity he sees (systemic) racism and the only solution to past discrimination is current discrimination. In addition, he redefines racism as every action or policy that doesn't reduce racial disparity. Looking through that lens, just about everything becomes systemically racist.",phulshof,2023-03-29,Ireland

If you demonize a race, then you are being racist, no matter if the other race is black, white, yellow or whatever.

You all, as Americans, you are not trying to eliminate prejudice, you are just trying to redirect it to another group, and this is so fundamentally wrong. I know you have history, but what are you doing do not make a better world. There are different ways to check history, and one of them is to know that what already happened, happened. If you want to punish people that was not there and is not responsible, then you will repeat history. 

And the race critical theory focus on white against black as if it is the only way of discrimination. While discrimination is something wrong, is also part of the nature, and we, the humans, are able to conquer that nature and look beyond it, and we should focus on being one and not to keep the separations that has been so harmful in the past.

1. An emergency-passed bill (why the fuck did HB1775 not go through normal channels to get passed - how fragile are snow-flake racists' feelings?)

2. A bill that was not yet in effect by the date that Mrs. Cook reported her school as being in violation of said HB1775 (Ignoring Mrs. Cook's history of violating Church/State and religious zealotry as well as her past violations of school rules in doing so)

3. A bill that did not apply to training of teachers, but only to content taught to students (when the violation Mrs. Cook reported was for content taught to teachers during a non-student day for professional development).

4. A supposed infraction of HB1775 with NO EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT ANYTHING INAPPROPRIATE WAS EVEN TAUGHT (but trust Mrs. Cook that for sure the audio totally violated her precious White-Fragility - no need for actual proof because she's a good God-fearing woman who would never cross a line for her religious misconceptions - it's not like she had a history of doing so).  The slides did not contain any evidence of an infraction and the board did not have access to the audio.

5. A punishment way above what was actually recommended (and one that was different than the punishment handed down to Mustang School District for a similar infraction of HB1775).

6. Specifically targeting TPS because their Superintendent is a vocal critic of Stitt / Ryan because that shit-clown duo are 100% provably corrupt money-launderers for the likes of Epic Charter schools (and don't get me started on Swadley's).

If you want a teaching job in a specialized subject I'd highly recommend it. 

It's really fucking tough. You do 4 placements a year and at the end of each placement you have to write a reflection portfolio in a week which can be upward of 60,000 words. In a week. Yes, sixty thousand, in 1 week.

You'll be placed in schools based on your needs. Do you suck at behavior management? You'll go to a school with lots if that. You suck at planning and assessment? You'll go to a school that will help you focus in that.

They expect your content knowledge to be that of a university graduate- you need to be prepared to teach the top band kids, or able to quickly adapt and problem solve to help them. You'll also be expected to be able to scaffold your concepts for really low learners too.

Teacher AND Sports OR Training OR PE OR Physical Education,https://www.reddit.com/r/chch/comments/ydtokf/has_anyone_done_the_secondary_teacher_training/,Has anyone done the secondary teacher training programme at New Zealand Graduate School of Education?,"I went to grad school \~7 years ago. Was an interesting time. Was definitely a lot of work, both in terms of doing 4 placements a year and all the grad school work before and after that. 

You essentially get handed a ""red"" book, which is a list of 'boxes' that you need to show that you comprehend and show throughout your teaching. Some of these you need to present to the tutors (usually working in groups) in whatever way you want (song, dance, poster, booklet etc). The rest are for 'bidding week', the week following each placement. You need to provide evidence of you doing these things and be very reflective on it. 

Grad school is a bit of a game. Even if you don't 100% agree with the way they go about things, you need to get them to sign you off, so do what they ask. You'll have more chance to establish your own teaching style more when you are in the job (e.g. grad school is big on almost silent classrooms, which I personally dislike). 

Benefits:

\- 4 placements - lots of chance to learn on the job

\- regular visits from tutors while you are teaching. Means you need to be on top of your game all the time. Also means you get very use to people observing your teaching

\- You'll learn good behavior management skills

\- Very high expectations on you. Start teaching within a couple of days of your placement. You need to be able to provide detailed lesson plans and unit plans (term 2 onwards) for every lesson. Expectation to be in at grad school after school days quite frequently, asking questions and getting help from the tutors (they keep a tally on this)

\- Exposure to lots of different situations. Special Education, reading to intermediate/primary students etc

\- Make good friends as you really need to work together to make the most of it. 

\- If you absolutely smash it, you can get out in 3 terms and begin working quicker.

Cons:

\- Lots of work. You'll need to constantly be collecting evidence throughout your placements to use when bidding. You'll end up with a completely full binder of paper. 

\- Bidding week sucks. But you'll get through it.

\- Reliant on your associate teacher for a lot of the subject specific stuff. This can be fine if you get a good associate teacher, but can be pretty bad if you get one who isn't too helpful. Grad school tends not to be too helpful in creating resources, asking questions about assessments etc.

Having a 504, ensured that I was legally protected to have my accommodations, and it lasted all 4 years of high school, as well as into college. It sounds like that is something you should look into as well.

That said, exercise is an important part of treatment (barring any conditions for which graded exercise is a bad idea, like ME/CFS). You seem to know this already, as you've been doing your recumbent exercises. You could show him the CHOP protocol and see if you can't work something out for the days you do feel up to it -- maybe a MWF schedule, as the person in charge of my rehab cautions me against working out more than 2 days in a row. This might also get across to him just how difficult exercise is for you.

People with PoTS decondition really quickly so it's great if you can keep a routine going, even if it's just two minutes a day. Also because PoTS makes us all very sedentary, it's really easy to put on weight which can lead to diabetes, and lack of exercise can also lead to a reduction in bone density making later life difficult too. The more you can move your body, strengthen your core, strengthen your legs, the better you'll feel physically and mentally - but obviously all within the limits of your PoTS.

One other thing, if your PE teacher continues to be a tw\*t about your condition, it might be worth trying to involve them. They're new, they want to make a good impression, and they might have some ideas as to how to support your PoTS journey. Get a meeting with them and a parent or guardian and discuss how the PE lessons can work best for both of you. Good luck!

I‚Äôll be honest: It‚Äôs possible, but I won‚Äôt sugarcoat it, it‚Äôs going to be tough for you. PE  positions are tough to come by, mostly because there are typically 4 or fewer PE teachers per school and they have a much lower turnover rate. It‚Äôs a competitive field, so it‚Äôs going to be tough to get a principal to choose you over others who are more qualified (with experience in the field).

That being said, it‚Äôs not impossible. But here is what you need to do to have a chance of accomplishing this: 
1. Get fully certified - you will be easily overlooked if you are not certified in PE in your state, find out exactly what you need to do and do it. This most likely will include going back to school and will 100% include passing some tests
2. Research - you need to know exactly how a PE class should be run and function. What made you interested in PE in the first place? PE isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúlet me teach you the rules of basketball‚Äù you need a knowledge of kinesiology, biomechanics, pedagogy, and the SHAPE standards. Know them like the back of your hand
3. Experience - you need experience doing something at least vaguely PE related in order to be considered. You‚Äôre in marketing and that doesn‚Äôt quite translate. Do you coach? Do you have experience working with children? Do you have any experience teaching anything?

Like I said, it‚Äôs possible, but it‚Äôs a long road ahead. It‚Äôs certainly not going to happen overnight, but if you stick with it you can accomplish it. My journey into PE took me about 4 years",[deleted],2021-03-30,Ireland
Teacher AND Sports OR Training OR PE OR Physical Education,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/mgju4w/how_to_become_a_physical_education_teacher_at_30/,How to become a Physical Education teacher at 30?,"I‚Äôm in my mid 30s and recently got my career switcher license to teach PE. The program was 17 weeks and I had to pass the Praxis for health/PE. The course load and pace were pretty intense, but we only met on Saturdays (plus a one-week placement in a school) so that we could continue our current jobs while working towards the license. 

After getting my license, I applied to 20 schools, got an interview for 2, accepted the offer on the first because it was elementary (my preference). One thing that I will say is that having no teaching experience, they probed pretty hard to see how knowledgeable I was and what other relative experience I had. Also, they asked the question I was dreading- ‚Äúwhat sports/activities are you willing to coach/sponsor?‚Äù. My real answer is ‚Äúnone‚Äù (I got my license and applied to be a teacher- not a coach), but I lied of course. I‚Äôm going to be working part-time as a personal trainer in the evenings, so I‚Äôll have a valid excuse when they inevitably ask me later. 

If you really want to do this, go for it and don‚Äôt give up! The week that I received the calls, I was just about to quit my job search after filling out so many lengthy applications, personalizing every cover letter, and sending follow up emails. I started to feel like I‚Äôd never get a job because my application would be passed over for teachers with a traditional educational background or real experience. As a new teacher, especially in the PE field where some schools only need one or two of us, it was seeming like an impossible task to even get an interview (I also have an old misdemeanor DUI, which I‚Äôm sure is an automatic disqualification for some recruiters). My advice is to take the first job you get offered, get the experience, and then start applying again if you don‚Äôt like the school. Also, if you‚Äôre a male or minority, use that to your advantage. Many districts are trying to hit diversity and inclusion hiring goals so that their teaching staff is more reflective of their student body.

This teacher in retaliation put a hit out on the district to report Tulsa to the CRT police to get their accreditation removed. Our dollar general governor Kevin Stitt ran with it, as did his road rage lickspittle secretary, Ryan Walters.

&#x200B;

The Seminar was literally about trying to reduce suspensions for children of color, who are disproportionately suspended while at school, helping to fuel the school to prison pipeline.

&#x200B;

They demoted the largest school district in Oklahoma to accreditation with warning, because of revenge. They wanted revenge because Tulsa Public Schools' superintendent, Dr. Deborah Gist, told Stitt off about reopening during the pandemic, calling him a bully. Because Gist emasculated Stitt directly, Stitt has been in a pissing contest trying to hurt Tulsa for the longest. Oklahoma has the most petty governor in the country.

&#x200B;

Now, we have learned there was violation whatsoever, and that this was all about trying to attack political enemies. This is some bullshit!

&#x200B;

So, you just saw that! Now, the anti-CRT crowd is fully admitting they never cared about CRT. They just don't want to have anything taught that involves race whatsoever. They don't care about helping black and brown children while at school. They only care to silence the fact there are problems involving race. This is some BS. Even if there exists to be factual evidence of disparity by race, now they are saying if you even acknowledge that, it's a violation.

I wonder how the CRT panickers like Christopher Rufo will defend that.",southpawFA,2022-08-05,Ireland

#collectivefacepalm


Yet another teacher, she taught us Marathi and she had a very condescending attitude towards children in general. Once, she was once making my friend read out something. She asked my friend his name and he said that his name was xyz Thakur. Then she asked him if he was a Thakur why was his Marathi so poor. My friend replied that his mother tongue wasn't Marathi. Immediately she chips in saying Thakur is always Marathi, so possibly my friend was lying and that he was never a Thakur.

Hopefully, it works out for her.

Teaching kinda fucking sucks. Eight years in, and I still haven't crossed into $50k. I'm at $ 48k - $49k before you take out all the healthcare and other taxes. 

RANTING STARTS HERE, just figured a warning would be nice. 

Good for people like her who are still pursuing education. I teach high school math, and I will tell them to reconsider if they're thinking of becoming teachers. 

It might not be so bad, but they keep changing the curriculum and textbook. Cuz you know, math is always fucking changing /s.

Then, they give us standards that don't line up with the approved text, so we have to supplement a bunch of shit. If you don't understand what I mean. Think of it this way. Imagine someone giving you the instructions to build a bed, but the parts for a different bed. I've easily put in 100s of hours of unpaid overtime on weekends and after school hours.

It's partly on me, too, because I don't just get stuff off the internet and use it as-is like some of my colleagues. I Frankenstein my own stuff from various resources because a lot of what I've seen in texts and stuff doesn't cut it. Also, I'd eventually lie to sell my lesson plans to other teachers. Textbooks have so much fluff.

The kid who wants to identify as a girl, is not a girl biologically, so sports should be held to that standard.  This is the pendulum of ‚Äúsocial Justice‚Äù swinging way too far from where it was.

Teacher AND Sports OR Training OR PE OR Physical Education,https://www.reddit.com/r/TexasTeachers/comments/vosv86/pe_teacher_job_prospects/,PE Teacher job prospects,"PE is rather hard to get into sometimes because every coach wants to do PE and just coach. I teach Science and Coach at the MS level here in North Dallas area. Most coaches die in those PE spots because you don‚Äôt really lesson plan, no HW, no tests, and no classroom duties or scores. The administrators leave you alone really. Plus they are hall monitors for STAAR Testing so PE teachers have it made. Your best PE chance would be at the MS level as HS PE teachers are all Football Coordinators or Head Coaches for other sports.

Most teachers that are Vets tend to be very strict and can easily blow up. We hired one at my campus and he ripped kids a new one and one kid told his parent and they raised hell‚Ä¶the guy wasn‚Äôt there after that. Remember it‚Äôs not the military and most of the time, kids aren‚Äôt going to be in ‚Äúready‚Äù position. In general thats where most people get teaching wrong.

Has anyone been down this path, or a similar one? What‚Äôs the best route. Thanks in advance.","Hi.  That's me!  So, I original credentialed in Mild/Mod special education and multiple subjects (general elementary) in California.  Teaching sped was very challenging and not for me.  I taught Kinder for a year and third grade for four years.  I really enjoy teaching general education classroom, though it's an incredible amount of work every year.  I then had aspirations to become a science teacher in the near distant future so I've gained my middle school science credential and also biology credential.  During that time for studying for the science tests, my elementary principal wanted to move me grade levels from 3rd to 2nd due to enrollment issues.  I balked, and started to look at other schools in the district for a 3rd grade position.  My principal wanted to keep me so she offered me PE.  It never crossed my mind to teach PE until then, but I accepted because I thought it could be fun and good at it.  For my first year I was on an ""emergency credential"" and I didn't have any PE tests passed or a PE credential.  During my first year I took the PE test which consists of three subtests.  I've studied and passed csets for all the other subjects, and so I was already skilled at studying and testing for them.  I used a study prep book to prepare, and I passed two of the three subtests on my initial attempt.  I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I was a bit personally upset that I actually failed one of the PE subtests.  I never failed any other subtest for the other subtests.  The PE subtest was a bit bogus because some of the questions are ridiculously over specific.  Where I had to improve was to make sure I knew the technical language for body motions while giving instructions.  I passed on my second attempt, and then in California I needed to take a single course through online UCLA.  I've taken the online course through UCLA for science as well, and by far the PE course was way easier.  Less work, less thinking.  It was just all lesson planning in detail and describing different philosophies of PE education or methods.  Then I submitted all that for certification, which is it's own bureaucratic process and wait. Teaching PE is wayyyyyyyyy less work than elementary.  Less after school prep, and you just repeat lesson plans all day.  PE also sells itself to kids, so very little behavioral management is needed.  Additionally, kids all think you are the best ever.  It's so not fair compared to a classroom teacher.  You very quickly become the most popular teacher at the school.  I still plan on making the transition someday to teaching science, but I've decided I'd like to ride out a bit longer on teaching PE for maybe 5 more years.  It's too good of a gig.  Teaching PE to Kindergarten takes the most finesse because you're dealing with Kindergarteners.  Also, some states are more in need for PE teachers than others.  I'm currently moving to Oregon, and PE is one of their subjects that they need teachers in.  This is because they don't allow teachers to add PE later on, at least for their own state.  But, they allow teachers who added on in other states to count.  It's a weird backdoor loophole that works for me.  Let me know if there's any specific thing you'd like me to comment on.",CoyoteClem,2021-04-14,Ireland

Stand out by talking about how you would make connections to academics, work with students with IEPs, and build relationships with students that may have issues in the classroom.  I would say focus on building relationships with students and staff in the building and understanding how you can support them in pe (or any elective really).

There may actually be benefit for him in receiving physical or occupational therapy, talk to kiddo's doctor. There may be some underlying reasons why he has trouble, such as low muscle tone, issues dealing with proprioceptive or vestibular input, poor gross motor skills, to name a few. These are all decently common with autism. Depending on if and what is going on, occupational or physical therapy can address those underlying concerns so he can access physical activity without feeling overwhelmed. 

I don't know who the hell told you that he is ""too old"" for help, there is not a magical window that is only open till age 5 (this is an extremely common myth among parents that they have to do EVERYTHING early). There are options available. ",tyrelltsura,2018-09-07,Ireland

(physical education) in high school. Can anyone else relate to this?,"Your high school PE sounds so different to mine. I avoided it as much as I could. There was no way anyone was allowed to get away with walking and chatting on the track, the teachers would be yelling at us not to stop and basically the only reason you would get away with stopping is if you had an asthma attack or similar. At the end of the 200m sprint I last down convinced I couldn't breathe and just got yelled at cos I didn't have a doctor's note saying I was asthmatic. 

The cross country course was the worst. Can't remember if we did it in first year of high school (age 11) or not, but I remember we had to wear ""gym knickers"" which were basically just big pants that covered nothing and we petitioned in third year to be allowed short shorts instead. Also we only did cross country in the winter. The course was a little over a mile and there was always a teacher at the back making sure you didn't stop running for long. I had no idea of how to pace myself and we weren't given any advice in the matter just told to run, so I would end up gasping for breath within a couple of hundred yards. 

Track we only ever did in the summer and I think the furthest we had to do was 800m but could just be I skipped the days we were meant to do more. I got special permission to quit PE and games lessons altogether for my fifth year (and no one did them beyond that), only joined a few when they did orienteering cos I liked the map reading and the short sections of sprinting then stopping suited me better. High school managed to put me off all sport and any form of exercise until a good ten years after I left. When everyone in 6th form (final two years of high school) had Wednesday afternoons off to do sport or volunteering I chose to do advanced maths lessons to get an extra maths qualification.

In recent years I trained and ran a 10k just to prove I could do it. Mostly I proved I'm definitely not built for running, I'm pretty sure I have mild asthma and I just hate the feeling in my lungs. I had to put in ten times more training than my friends for the same race and I know someone who ran that with no prior running training at all.

half the people online claim Russia is a shit ally because it didnt help us defend Artsakh and we need to cut ties with them while the other half claim we need to integrate with Russia an be under more of their rule. 

Its clear that after the Artsakh war, Aliyev wanted to encroach on Armenian land and slowly chip away at Zangezur, the fact that Russia is building another military base/splitting their existing one to deploy troops along the eastern Armenian borders shows that theyre going to carry out their treaty obligations with Armenia. 

Aliyev is very pissed right now because even though Armenians internal politics is a shitshow, hes failing to take advantage of the situation and occupy more land almost entirely because of the Russia-Armenia ally-ship. Rumor is that Aliyev wants out of the Nov 9 agreement because of all the help AM is getting from Russia which is why he wont return POWs but of course Russia wont let Aliyev pull out so easily like that, its gonna continue to force the implementation of the agreement because Russia benefits from it too. 

If Aliyev does get ballsy, decide to throwaway his victory and withdraw from the agreement, i wonder what the Russian, Turkish and the international reaction would be considering the agreement hes withdrawing from is his agreement. Regardless, deploying Russian troops on the international recognized Armenian side of the border during the war was a 400IQ play and Armenians need to see Russia as what it is, a military ally that has its own interests, as Armenia builds up, it needs to do the same, act at its own interests while using its alliances to its advantage.",T0ManyTakenUsernames,2021-03-21,Ireland

There has always been a two tier system, attempts half a century ago to level the playing field with scholarships to private schools etc. have been eroded and now even for those within state schools there are children who rely on teachers only, and attempt to learn in crowded, threatening and disruptive environments, and those whose parents can afford to supplement or replace their education with online learning. Online is a good model for some subjects and a poor one for others, but like retail there needs to be a significant pivot to stop education failing. As striking impacts non-unionised working parents negatively, and teachers are not as universally liked and valued as nurses, public sympathy for strikes is lacking, and the government know this and will wait it out, hoping for the right wing press to applaud them as modern-day Thatchers.",Few-Acanthocephala85,2023-04-04,Ireland

Makes it impossible to save to get anywhere like further education or saving for a deposit, let alone paying bills.

Honestly, imagine working in a busy bar/restaurant with four other people but you're the only one allowed to serve alcohol because you're the only staff member over 18.

Ontario teaching regulations are stupid, draconian, and have resulted in the poor science and math teaching in Ontario to the point that Ontario is FAR behind Quebec. 

Because of the regulatory body teachers who have a poor history in math and science often end up teaching these subjects. All they transfer to kids is confusion, anxiety, feelings of stupidity, and a huge hatred of math and science to the point that the kids brain literally turns off when they see problems related to those subjects. 

Teaching is a profession. Some teachers are good others are bad. A regulatory body does nothing to remove the bad teachers, it actually protects their position. 

We‚Äôd do far better to track these professionals using an app where their education and experience, as well as feedback can be tracked.

Supporters of Senate Bill 486 say changes like that will free schools from regulations they say are onerous.

...

> SB 486 would let school administrators choose not to discuss decisions about classroom sizes, curriculum and other similar topics with their teachers‚Äô union representatives. The bill also would strip down teacher training and evaluation requirements currently in state law.
> 
> During testimony, provisions other than the first got limited attention. Opponents worry the bill will silence teachers' voices, leading to more leaving the profession and weakening the quality of education in Indiana.
> 
> ‚ÄúWe're tired of screaming what we need and we're tired of not being heard. Teacher working conditions are student learning conditions. You will codify our silence with this bill,‚Äù said Allison Haley. ‚ÄúTeacher voice is imperative. Can we just call this what it is? An attack on a majority women profession that requires the demanding and exhaustive combination of intellect, professionalism and empathy.‚Äù

...

> ‚ÄúWhen we can't discuss why 15 teachers left mid year and there's no one to watch your kids, that's on you,‚Äù Haley said. ‚ÄúWhen we can't discuss safety and respond to a student threat, and Noblesville has another shooting, that's on you. All of those are discussable topics that might not happen ‚Ä¶ And that is on you. Please respect us and listen and vote no on 486.‚Äù

> Supporters argue it‚Äôll free teachers and administrators up to do their jobs in the way that best fits their local communities rather than responding to top-down mandates from the state.",saryl,2023-04-11,Ireland

I'm sure if they had their way, red states would be places where slavery, censorship, forced birth, religious education, and mob justice were the order of the day.

Edit: somebody replied ""democrats were for slavery,"" but I can't see it now. Maybe he deleted it. To that, this was the old democratic party, before the party switch. LBJ had the audacity to support a liberal republican, so the southern dixiecrats abandoned the party. The liberal republicans didn't care for the new neighbors and became democrats.

She had retired around that same year. One time she had the bright idea to laso a deer after she got close enough to it. Thought maybe she could turn it into a pet. The deer dragged her butt across the field lol. Another thing I remember is she had a nightmare that the school district called and said there had been a mistake, she had to come in and teach one more year. The relief she felt after waking up and realizing it was just a nightmare. She had so many plans and wanted to go on trips. She taught I think 25 years and ended up passing away a couple years after retirement.

* teachers work 180 days a year.  60k a year means they are paid $333 a day.

* a year of work for non teachers is 260 days and a 60k salary is $230 a day 

If you got paid $333 dollars a day and worked 260 days you would make 86k a year

You can want teachers to be paid $1,000 a day if you like.

Also at least if we end up home schooling you can teach them about more than just what they teach. Which is more damaging than learning these days. I think its time all kids get home schooling or at least take the government out of the situation. I think children benefit from different points of view, it allows them to have a open mind and allow for their own opinions. The schools and teachers are definitely pushing certain topics and none of others. It's the school systems that are pushing opinions on the children.also maiking it seem like a opinion or different perspective is wrong. We need to teach our children more than just certain subjects, teach them about all the different religions and politics. Because obviously not talking about politics has done more harm than good. Teach them how to have a civil conversation about difficult topics. But also the world they are growing up in and not one sided either but from both sides of the fence. They are being taught to be biased and not think for themselves.  We want them to challenge what's being told to them. Research things before believing that what is told to them is the truth or we get this, heard mentality, it's not long before this turns to socialism. It's a lot closer than people think. Plus they need to know the real history, Christopher Columbus wasn't a good person he mass murdered people. Also Samuel Adams isn't just a beer.

At the same time though, I would be very picky in deciding which school my child goes to. All because your school is highly rated doesn't mean it's a good school with good teachers, it may just be students who are coming already proficient and is good at sweeping problems under the rug. All because your school is Title I doesn't mean it's a crappy school, you may have the most dedicated teachers and the students are showing growth even if they're coming in behind, and admin may deal with behavioral issues. All because it's charter doesn't mean it's sole purpose is to make the owners rich and doesn't care about the children's education or well-being, especially true if it's a not-for-profit charter. All because it's private doesn't mean they're teaching at an appropriate level and don't have behavioral issues, there may be a family who is influencial/on the board/big donors whose kids make it worse for everyone around them but they can't get rid of them.

I am sending my child to public preschool next year, and likely public kindergarten the year after. However, I have nothing against homeschooling and might consider it for my family down the road. As of now however, my child does not have any siblings, or same-age family members close by. We are involved in activities as time and money allows, but I feel it will benefit him to be surrounded by peers and structure on a daily basis and help develop some of the skills he may have missed out on from Covid and a lack of siblings. 

However, I personally love home schooling and have witnessed first hand the many ways it can be done right (and of course, wrong). If, down the road, I feel that public school is not a good fit for my child, I would have no qualms homeschooling him myself. People need to remember that homeschooling does not have to mean cooped up at home all day everyday. The amount of opportunities available are staggering. When I was in high school, I was taking classes online, in person with groups of other homeschooled students, and taking classes at my local junior college. I played sports and participated in speech and debate and theatre. Imagine how many more opportunities there are 15 years later.

Of the 14 colleges she's applied to, she's been admitted to all 8 she's heard from and been offered full rides at two of them based on merit.  She's waiting on IV day to hear from Berkeley, Stanford and Columbia before making her decision.

The thing about public schools is that we have to be as much as we can to as many as we can without the support to be fully enough to any but we can and do still do great things for kids -- maybe not for every kid and maybe not in every school, but on the whole, we kinda rock. 

Even here in LA, where our schools have soooooo many issues, there are many many good schools and almost every school has great programs for some kids. 

I strongly believe that the only way we get to keep the good things we have is by investing in them and that means being committed to them as the best choice for our own kids.

That said, there are certainly circumstances where a non-public setting may be the best option -- public schools cannot be all things to all kids no matter how hard we try.

Edit: My experiences with homeschooling has left me pretty unimpressed with it's ability to provide a well-rounded academic foundation (separate from the social/emotional issues) even when undertaken by well-educated and well-intended parents.

He‚Äôs in 9th now. I also put my other kids in because I didn‚Äôt want him to feel like he was being excluded or do a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù thing without him. 

There are sooo many positives to homeschooling. So many. My kids had sooo much more than public school could ever offer. We had time for the extras (technically, we could still do some of the extras- but there just isn‚Äôt time) I don‚Äôt get the socialization thing at all. My kids were in so many classes and lessons and groups- they navigated many more situations than a kid in one classroom all day does. They took horseback riding lessons, chess club, art classes, board game group at the library, co-ops with fun classes like ‚Äúhistory with American girl books‚Äù and ‚Äúlego challenges‚Äù and also academic classes on writing and science labs. We regularly met up with others for park days. We had so many field trips! (One group we were a part of had each family plan a field trip each semester.) So there were plenty of options and you couldn‚Äôt possibly make it to all of them! 

But also, academics- my kids could work at their own pace and focus on their own interests. You can cover a LOT of academic content based on what they love. I have one that loves horses, another who loves rocks. 

Now, it is not all rainbows and unicorns. It is HARD to do all subjects with all kids on all different levels. It is hard to be motivated sometimes and kids fight with their siblings like it‚Äôs WW3. 

One of my deepest regrets is not being able to continue. 

On the other hand, my kids that don‚Äôt have ODD are straight A, top of the class students. One is an extrovert who LOVES school. Also, (I am a building sub at my youngest‚Äôs school) my mental health has dramatically improved. I love going to work. 

Also, I know some kids that were ‚Äúhomeschooled‚Äù before enrolling in 2nd,3rd or 4th grade at the school I work in and I get why teachers are against homeschooling.

Is this a place I want to send my kids?

I strongly believe in the ideal of a public education system, but what I look at each and every day does not inspire confidence that it‚Äôs the best for my (as of now, hypothetical) child. 

From technology use: I believe both in teaching children about technology *and* limiting its use yet I see in my school kids that are glued to Chromebook screens and Google Classroom (an absolute non-starter for me as a parent) for six hours a day yet have never really had instruction on the interfaces they are expected to use ‚Äì let alone concepts surrounding responsible internet use.

From educational opportunities that just aren‚Äôt there the way they were when I was in middle/high school. Inclusion (which I am not an opponent of) has seemingly stripped any opportunities for higher performing students to explore or excel beyond the streamlined classroom. I see teachers, with administration direction, using the idea of helping their peers as ‚Äúenrichment‚Äù opportunities for these students. I don‚Äôt see accelerated curriculum in any way, shape, or form for students who may benefit from it. Like I said, I don‚Äôt oppose Inclusion, but when we say that a ‚Äúrising tide lifts all boats‚Äù we fail to note that it also prevents eagles from soaring. As a concrete example, my wife is a university instructor whose program (not university, just her specific program) requires high school calculus as a pre-requisite. It may be Covid effected (in fact, I know it is) but for the current 6th-9th graders in my school district there is *no existing path* to a high school calculus course because they haven‚Äôt (or won‚Äôt be) been started on algebra soon enough. Two years from now I doubt it will be offered at all our high school and I don‚Äôt suspect it‚Äôll come back.

From school not being a welcoming place, or having a community feel. There‚Äôs every chance my schooling experience was atypical, but by the time I had reached my junior high school I *never* left my school building. It was to the library for homework (really socializing), it was to hang out behind the school or in the gym, it was to shoot the shit in the hallways. School wasn‚Äôt just school, it was a community that felt like a home to me. It served as a place where I could explore myself and my identity in a safe space ‚Äì I could take advantage of unstructured and unsupervised time with my peers to figure out who I was and was vitally important and formative in who I am today. Of course, even though it felt that way none of that time was unsupervised; there was custodial staff chiding us about bouncing the basketball in the hallway, teachers in their classrooms who had an ear out for what was happening in the hallway, parent volunteers chaperoning activities. Whatever you want to call it, there were lines at the payphone (I graduated high school in 1998) between 6 and 8 every evening with kids calling home for a ride. Today? Last bell is at 2:15 and the library shuts down at 2:30, can‚Äôt go there. SRO is guarding the door at dismissal and ensures that no student gets back in, forgot something in your locker? Too bad. Teacher wants to offer extra help after school? Well that‚Äôs great, just make sure the building is empty by 3:10 (really, my school is kicking the teachers out too). Loitering near the door before/after school? Either the SRO, the principal, or someone else is going to chase you away. School just isn‚Äôt a welcoming place.

The last one rankles me the most^, but is probably the lowest priority when thinking about should I send my kids to public school. Having endeavored on this career change in middle-age I am, frankly, appalled at the academic rigor that I see. If I were to have a child with special needs, I think a public school might be best suited to support them but if I had a child with the intellectual capability to soar I fear that public school would be a hindrance to their ability to succeed long-term. 

^ I get plenty of flak when I bring this up, and I get it: Liability. Safety. Teachers/staff aren‚Äôt paid to be there after last bell.

1) ""Public School Education"" refers to a system with a wide range of differences between communities, even just in the United States, and

2) ""Homeschool"" just means ""something else"", which can be literally anything. That said, it can be almost identical to traditional schooling with a co-op. I've even seen co-ops where parents chose to not be especially involved, so it wasn't very different at all.

""Far more beneficial"" leaves a lot to be desired. It ALL depends on your goals or expectations, and how much work you are willing to put in to get those needs met.

There are comprehensive homeschool networks. I've seen many where at its core it emphasizes socialization and PBL with a much more ""real world"" component; actually solving problems in the real world as opposed to curriculum inspired by reality, but the application is 100% fictional.",PencilIsForPaper,2023-03-13,Ireland

Advantages: I had no idea how brilliant my son was until I homeschooled him. We breezed through the state standards/ curriculum and I got to teach applicable concepts and above grade level. School was hardly ever more than four hours each day. Field trips were sometimes out of the city/ state. I let him choose one day a month he didn't want to have school and I chose one day as well. Supplies were cheaper buying for one and the science experiments were finally affordable. I got to build a relationship with my son in a way that was not there before because of how much I dedicated to my job. He still talks about the year I homeschooled him. 

Disadvantages: Even though I took him to the park daily to socialize with other kids his age, social learning and interaction during instruction was not something I could replicate and so perspective was not gained from learners with differing experiences. My living room looked like a classroom. I had anchor charts and his work all over my walls. We ate a little more luxuriously, and he gained a little weight. When he returned to school (my driving reason was for socialization) he was way ahead of his classmates because I had taught him above grade level when we finished the curriculum and he talks about wanting to learn something new in school. He is quite often bored. 

Do I think public education is more beneficial? Not in the district my son is in. If I knew other parents that wanted their children homeschooled, I would entertain teaching a pod of students.

I‚Äôve been teaching for nearly ten years and wouldn‚Äôt send my kids to schools in my state for all the money within that state. My wife homeschools our four children, and we‚Äôre heavily involved in our local school and church groups. Whatever benefits accrue from socialization are far, far outweighed by the academic advancements capable in homeschool environments. Plus, it seems accepted as a given in many of these remarks that all forms of socialization are developmentally appropriate, to which I would object.  For my kids right now, the best people to supervise their education and socialization are me and their mother. 

Of course, not all students are cut out for homeschooling, nor are all parents situated for it. For instance, it would be utterly unfair to expect a single parent to homeschool, and I certainly couldn‚Äôt do this without my wife. 

But thinking about the sheer volume of wasted instructional time in our public schools - from testing, from unruly students, from poorly designed curricula - it‚Äôs a no brainer for me. 

One thing I‚Äôll also add is that my wife - who is a former public school teacher in my district - experienced an irrational degree of doubt about her ability meaningfully to design and deliver instruction. It was as all the specialist certifications she didn‚Äôt possess somehow psyched her out of it for a while.  We were talking about this a few weeks ago and I asked her if, after 7 years, she felt any better situated to educate the kids. She said once she found the right system (not a curriculum per se but an approach) that‚Äôs consistent, repeatable, and progressively loaded - at about year 3 - then it was much better for her. 

This is definitely a thing that requires total commitment, and unlike public school, one can‚Äôt simply send the kids off home. The benefits though are quality time on task, effective discipline, you can differentiate for your kids‚Äô needs more than even the best teachers by dint of the very environment in which the learning takes place.

If I am where I currently am at the point my future child needs to start Kindergarten, I will homeschool at least through 8th grade. The high schools are fine enough for students who enjoy learning and have the academic talents, but our elementary  and middle schools have struggled to keep teachers even through a school year. I do not feel comfortable putting my child into a Kindergarten classroom without a teacher. Unless this school district changes and does not bleed teachers, it feels wrong of me when I can afford to homeschool.

If we move to the area my wife wants to, it would depend on if my child needs an IEP or not. My wife wants to move to be closer to her family, and our nephew's IEP has not been followed by his social studies teacher. The principal is backing the teacher on this even though the IEP is a legal document. My wife has ADHD, I have anxiety and diabetes, and we both may have autism, so we are aware our child may need support.

If we are in a different school district than the two above, I will be doing research to make sure my child will be okay.

For being around peers, there are a lot of programs where we live for that. I understand that argument, but as a secondary teacher, I have seen students come from private schools to public schools and becoming more and more like their peers who are not well-behaved. Starting a child around students who refuse to behave (I have friends who teach early elementary and they have a lot of behavior problems) seems worse to me than signing my child up for whatever program I can that they have interest in.

Regular public school works well for normative kids, which is generally true of any large scale institution, they tend to be made to fit the norms whatever those happen to be. That means they're also generally terrible places for outliers (and outliers exist in literally all populations). My kid is an outlier and she struggled tremendously in in person school, the kind of support she needed simply wasn't an option in the normative classroom and it was never going to be a good fit. Her education and social development were both suffering tremendously and since I have teaching experience I knew that the situation wasn't going to get better bc no amount of IEP meetings could magically make her into a normative kid. I've seen too many outlier kids fall through the cracks and be horribly failed by the system, a system that is in most cases doing its level best to help, but that best is rarely good enough. So when the pandemic started we took the opportunity to try out homeschooling and it has been a tremendous success. She's getting the academics that suit her (which is great bc thanks to disability her progress is lopsided, advanced in reading and writing but behind in math) and we live in an area with a robust YMCA system and large local homeschool co op groups so she still gets to have plenty of social stuff and time with other adults but it's usually with other kids who are also outliers and other adults who understand how outlier kids work so she's not experiencing the bullying and outcast stuff she was in normative school. Going to school won't make normative kids like, play with, or be nice to the weird kids, all it does is give the mean normative kids a permanent target and forces the weird kids into a cruel and isolating nightmare they can't escape which is the opposite of how healthy socializing works.

It depends on your kid and what is right for your family.

Yes, there are certain benefits to being in the PS system that we're all familiar with so I won't enumerate them here, but we all know kids who don't thrive in that system as well. It's very cookie cutter and ""one size fits all"" despite me and my colleagues ongoing efforts to create a differentiated learning environment. 

This is why each family needs to make that decision for themselves, based on their values, what is available to them and what resources they have in their community. There is no perfect solution, no matter what you choose to do there will be things that don't quite work the way you want them to, so you need to give yourself the permission to borrow from the other side of the fence and make a solution that works for you. For example, if possible, give your kids days off and go to the movies, do stuff together at home, go on short trips in the middle of the week -- behave like you're homeschoolers! Or, enroll the kids in structured classes with other children, send them to camp or sign them up for a sport so they're getting the benefits of a structured environment made for groups of children.

What ever you choose, make sure it's right for you and give yourself permission to fine tune the solution as time goes on because people's needs change over time.

It surprises me when I meet moms who determined they were homeschooling before they even had kids. Clearly for them it was never about the best interests of the child, but the desires of the mom.

That being said, I am glad homeschooling exists as an option. Homeschooling could be the best option for any given child for all sorts of reasons. Yes, homeschooling is classist. It's not an option available to everyone. But then again, neither is moving for a better school district, or putting your child in a private school. These things all take time and money, which not everyone has.

As a public school employee, the homeschoolers I meet are the ones who returned to public school because something wasn't working. So like every public school employee, my perspective is skewed. How would I meet any brilliant and socially well adjusted homeschoolers, if they don't attend public school? By the same token, if you're successfully homeschooling, you're probably predominantly only encountering other successful homeschooled kids. You're unlikely to see some of the horrific situations we do and may feel comfortable making sweeping generalizations. Just as public school employees do.

I don't believe parents are good judges of whether their kid is socially well adjusted (ie., the ""my mom thinks I'm cool"" trope). Parents may know whether their kid is a successful communicator with other adults, which many homeschooled kids seem to be. But being able to successfully interact with peers from a wide variety of backgrounds is an experience I don't know how any homeschooling family could provide on an ongoing basis. Homeschooling is by its very nature socially limiting. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing or just a ... thing ... depends on so many other factors.

Homeschooling still may be the best choice for a child. I just don't understand why it's anyone's first choice.",Key-Librarian912,2023-03-13,Ireland

And they have all the time in the world to learn any academic field they want but only maybe 15 years max to actually enjoy being a child.

I haven't decided what to do yet, but I've been in a bit of haze especially at work where I now see myself as a prison warden in the child's prison we have created as a society.

So homeschooling looks even more appealing to me as a way to avoid public schooling if ""democratic"" style schools aren't available.",thermomax,2023-03-14,Ireland

Yes yes, I get that public school is a way for kids to develop social skills but it‚Äôs not the only way. I was a teacher for 10 years, walked out just before Christmas. Why? I was about an inch away from having a mental breakdown, so rather than end up hospitalized I chose to take care of myself. 

Public school is not about education anymore, it‚Äôs about numbers and control. I see it everyday in the decisions that are made by people who supposedly care about children. I see kids struggling to be at school and struggling to engage with the teachers. They are either too involved in their devices or are in fear of being shot by some psychopath. I wouldn‚Äôt want to be in school either.

So yeah, I‚Äôd be homeschooling my kids and other people should too. Public school is not a total waste of time mind you, they‚Äôre still good things about it, but it‚Äôs darn near close to it, especially since we‚Äôve basically got rid of traditional libraries, home economics, and the arts. It‚Äôs all just STEM, sports, and trade school. The latter two things I don‚Äôt believe should even be in public school at all. 

There should be pro sports and that‚Äôs it, we don‚Äôt need sports in public school. Yes kids can learn valuable life skills in sports but they can also learn those same skills in other activities. Trade school, while valuable, should be an adult education school and not be part of the public school day to day schedule because it takes up too much space and time for other things. If a kid wants to learn to be a mechanic or electrician great, they can do that that after high school. 

Kids in public school should only be learning 9 basic subjects or variations of them from the time they get in elementary school until they graduate high school: Science, Technology, English, Math, Social Studies, Home Economics or Life Skills, Health, Physical Education, and the Arts. Anything else is a hinderance. You can agree or disagree, I don‚Äôt really care. That‚Äôs my two cents on the matter.",Efficient_Pride9237,2023-03-14,Ireland

It has been the plan from the start. I was homeschooled myself as well as my most of my siblings. Most people picture homeschoolers as kids that are stuck at home, mom is teaching them from a textbook, everyone sits around the diningroom table. While there are plenty that do this it also can look a lot different we spent far more time exploring, reading, playing games, and learning about things we were interested in than a public, private, or charter school could provide.

Since we always seem to be asked, ""but what about socialization?"" There are a ton of homeschooling groups. We had a homeschooling science club/class, homeschooling art club, the Y would run a gym class for homeschoolers, volunteering in many different forms, there were programs at the library we went to, programs at the zoo, programs at the conservatory, programs at the arboretum, etc. As well as a homeschooling conference we went to every year that provided things such as a science fair and places to display projects that people had been working on during the last year.

As far as learning to deal with other people, we got opportunities to deal with a wider range of people and with people of different ages. Unlike in a school setting where you are learning to deal only with people your own age and a few members of staff. 

What about teaching something you don't know? This gets easier as children get older. First off there are plenty of online options now for classes for any age group. For older students, many of the homeschools I know would take college classes at a local community college as soon as they hit highschool starting to earn college credit.

I don't think school is overall more beneficial in the long run for students. We spend so much time on student behaviors interrupting lessons, preparing students for standardized tests, taking said standardized tests, random assemblies, etc. That get in the way of teaching students. 

I also fully understand that homeschooling is not for everyone for many different reasons. We need public schools. I just will not be choosing public, private, or charter) schools for my children.",bluescrim,2023-03-13,Ireland

Having taught primarily pre-K, K and 1st, I would love to take time off and homeschool my kids for preschool. I have lots of experience and expertise when it comes to that age group and I know exactly what skills and knowledge kids need to be really ready to start school in kindergarten. 

I would definitely not homeschool beyond preK however, for the following reasons:

1.  I, like many other teachers in this thread, have noticed a definite trend of previously homeschooled kids lacking in social and academic skills and just more generally lacking the ability to cope with minor setbacks. It's not just socialization, it's also learning to tolerate non-preferred people, activities and settings as well as overall independence.

2. I am an idealistic sucker at heart and I truly believe that public schools are a key part of having a functional society. While they aren't perfect I would rather fight to make them better than abandon such an important institution. I also think that one of the most important things students get out of public school is learning how to navigate and participate in the public sphere. Any environment where only certain people are welcome just cannot replicate this experience.

3. I am a primary teacher. I'm sure I could do great at homeschooling for the first few years, but I know I am not the best option for teaching my kid upper elementary content. Ask me to take over a 5th grade class and I'd suck at it for awhile. High school? Forget about it. I am not qualified to do that. 

I don't mean to be rude, but I really don't understand people who have no experience in education or childhood development and yet think they will be better at teaching their kid than an entire team of professionals who have training and experience in whatever subject / age / developmental stage the kid happens to be in at a given moment.",icfecne,2023-03-14,Ireland

I notice many people mention that they would be concerned about ‚Äúpeer time‚Äù. And I agree this is super important for development, as humans are social beings and require group social skills. Developing them at a young age is best.

But my counter argument to that, is that their are social events and gatherings specifically for homeschool kids. 

Otherwise, I believe if you‚Äôre a teacher the greatest gift you can give your child is that constant attention ‚Äòin the classroom‚Äô.

Public schools often group under-performing and over-preforming students in the same room, where teachers can‚Äôt afford the time to really devote to one-on-one with each student. This causes some students to be left behind, and others not reach their fullest potential.

If your are homeschooling your student, or can afford them a tutor, odds are they will be miles ahead of others their age when it comes time for college. And that is the goal, to give them an exceptional education, focused attention, and put them ahead in years of study so perhaps they can begin the next stages of education or life earlier.",IllustratorAlive1174,2023-03-13,Ireland

Public schools teach you how to cope with the real world.

I have seen it at the college level (went to college with some k-12 homeschooled kids and it was even a very small sheltered private university) and I have seen it when previously home schooled kids try to integrate into public school. They're at a distinct disadvantage because they have not learned the social cues and coping skills of dealing with less than ideal circumstances.

We have a house and no mortgage (the benefit of my husband and father-in-law building us a house!). This is absolutely on the cards for us as an option.

The reason for this is that you cannot trust teachers to be objective politically and religiously. Teachers are required to teach the indigenous religion; creation story, and prayers and all, but are not allowed to teach about other beliefs. It is argued it's not a belief... but as a religious person... lol, yeah it is a belief.  


Even schools that supposedly teach my beliefs teach other weird additions to it that do not align with my theology for a myriad of specific, gritty reasons that would leave a child very confused. I would just teach them what I believe is right from the beginning... save myself the trouble of undoing a lot of weird beliefs. 

There are a lot of views that are classed under ""acceptance"" which I personally think should be a parent's right to educate children about (sexuality and gender being the two that come to mind). I don't mind children being exposed to those ideologies, but I have issues with their morality being weighed upon by the teachers. 

Basically... schools are too political. I have confidence in my own teaching ability. My child/ren would receive a tailored education. My husband was homeschooled- I have since learned that these children have a lot of other children to socialise with. So exposure to different beliefs would happen in these controlled, observed settings. While children are young, these things must be guarded (raise children in the way you want them to continue when they are grown), but one day it will be up to them to decide the life and beliefs they wish to lead. 

The values we deem important would be taught. This includes many of the values our curriculum touts, don't get me wrong. But I can drop the stuff my worldview disagrees with, and add the stuff that doesn't, all while giving my child a practical education (cleaning, gardening, instruments, cooking) as well as the very important literacy and mathematic skills.

There can really be a huge downside to homeschooling. I really wanted friends in my teenage years. I WANTED to go to normal high school, but my mom did not let me go to the public HS in our district due to its bad rep. 

It was lonely. I was understimulated. I really wanted to do well in my school work still, but I struggled terribly with math, and without any help or intervention, I just couldn't do it by myself and eventually gave up trying. Even if you take away that element and if I had a tutor (which I eventually did get one but he was a jerk and I hated working with him), I didn't get the chance to make those life long friends that many people make in HS. 

I am currently 32 and I believe not having had significant socialization during my formative years stunted my growth in terms of social interaction. Till this day I still struggle to open up in social situations and am working on it. If you're gonna homeschool your children, you should make sure they're going to have a social life, somehow. 

I eventually went on to get my GED at 18. I failed terribly at algebra the first time, which reflected how I did not get the help during homeschooling. Going from a very lax homeschooling curriculum where i basically was not getting educated enough in a lot of areas to suddenly being thrusted into college was incredibally stressful to the point of almost being traumatic. I had to catch up on A LOT. Thankfully, i was naturally bright and was starting to get good grades in the majority of my gened courses. 

Then, I buckled down, took algebra again with a better teacher, and got a B-. I'd go on to get my bachelor's and graduate cum laude. Almost a decade later I'm now finishing up my master's in teaching. Homeschooling didn't stop me from excelling academically in the long run, but it certainly did deprive me of having social interactions and friends during a time when I should have. If you choose to homeschool you're child make sure they get the support they need academically and that they will have a way of making friends.",Paullearner,2023-03-13,Ireland

This meant that any ""enrichment"" was through our parents and my family didn't really have room for me on the calendar. The religion component was disturbing in hindsight, and I've never seen a public school so politically biased.  It would have been a lot better for me (I think - no way to know for certain) for me to go through the public system. 

Then I got older and my parents sent me to a parochial high school that was bigger, but still couldn't compete with the public system. I hated it there. It didn't have the things I wanted, and was far enough away that I struggled to access the things it did have.

I think homeschooling is the best way to go if you can afford it and do it with fidelity.

If you are a dedicated homeschool family your will academically stomp kids at factory model school (both public and private).  Typical schools have endless wasted time.  Waiting for class to start, waiting for others to finish their work, waiting for class to end.  With home school you can get the same work done faster and have time left over for things that you want to do e.g. Equestrian, Art, 3D Printing/Design, Music, Exploring the World.

Many homeschoolers are part of a regional home school association which offer weekly classes, organized sports, dances, proms, etc...   It runs very much like a co-op and can have a thousand kids or more.

As a teacher I have seen two types of homeschoolers.

Type I - Kids who were homeschooled because of difficulties at school e.g. dyslexia, learning disabilities.  The homeschooling shielded them from peers in their parents mind.

Type II - Normal kids  who have much better behavior and off the scale academic performance.   They are often more empathetic to their peers, willing to help, and willing to lead and volunteer.  The homeschooling helped them outperform their peers.

Also, homeschoolers seem to be much less anxious and more present then their peers.  Just my observations from 10 years of observing homeschoolers.

It all depends on the kids and the families.",usa_reddit,2023-03-14,Ireland

I have two questions:

2. What do you think that public school teachers are teaching kids that you would want to place them in a private system instead?

I‚Äôm honestly curious, not here to start an argument or anything like that.

So a move to an education voucher system would be a great idea, that way parents can make an even more significant vote that reflects their views, and a vote that can‚Äôt be stifled or ignored, it will be a vote with funding.

Hawaii. A starting teacher with a bachelor's gets $38k. Master's degree? $54k... In fucking Hawaii! $38k, you're homeless in Hawaii, $54k? Living in an apartment with a roommate.

Think about how that reflects on our students. We teachers are the epitome of education; we got degrees, we have an important role in society, and yet they can't pay us a living wage. I've been teaching for 13 years now, and I've seen at least a couple hundred teachers come and go.

I tell my students, this is not a right or left issue; this is a top and bottom issue. It's the rich vs the rest. I'm constantly telling them, my generation (millennials) outnumber the boomers, and their generation (generation z) outnumber us... Become important people. Follow politics and VOTE.

I'm just hoping that we're not too late. The system appears to be so rigged, that I'm not sure if voting even matters anymore. I feel like we're at a point where we need a reset, plain and simple.

""There's a reason education sucks, and it's the same reason it will never ever be fixed. It's never going to get any better. Don't look for it. Be happy with what you have. Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners, now; the real owners; the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything....

""They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want: they want more for themselves and less for everyone else. But I'll tell you what they *don't* want: they don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.... They don't want people smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they're getting f---ed by a system that threw them overboard 30 years ago....

""You know what they want? Obedient workers. Obedient workers. People just smart enough to run the machines and do the paper work, and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.... They'll get it all from you sooner or later, because they own this place. It's a big club, and you ain't in it.""

I'm not advocating to returning to previous status quo. I'm not saying our teachers are not smart.

The positive effect was we had extremely competent and smart teachers and nurses. As more opportunities opened up for women in other sectors, the smartest women were able to move into better  opportunities.  Good for them.  The negative consequences is that teaching and nursing lost a lot of brain power.  Nursing compensation has increased. It is not enough yet to make up the difference yet.  Teaching compensation is abysmal.  Add school shootings and lack of supplies, it's a recipe for disaster.  Increasing compensation will help.

Spencer Cox just signed a bill that would allow parents to use public dollars on private school tuition, and it raised teacher salaries. Huckabee Sanders' plan is similar, allowing public funds to be spent on private schooling and limiting instruction about race and gender identity.

Its not a bipartisan cause when the solutions one side is proposing will make our class-based education problem worse. 

Public Funds being spent on private schools means less money for public schools.  So cool, teachers are getting ""paid more"", but the districts they will serve will have even less funding than before.

>Mississippi: Teachers saw their largest pay hike in decades after Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed into law increases averaging $5,100, raising salaries by more than 10%. 

This is depressing when you see Mississippi's avg. 

>For Suzanne Smith, a math and social studies teacher in Grenada, Miss., the $5,100 salary jump has not sunk in yet ‚Äî it is the largest one she has seen in the more than three decades she has spent in this field. The average salary for a Mississippi schoolteacher is $46,843, the lowest in the nation, according to the National Education Association.

46K is about 23$/Hour. Answer to ""but teachers don't work 40 hours a week"", is total bullshit if you know what a teacher has to do.

This is true not just in education. Having worked at multiple levels of childcare and education. I can tell you that the worst places are the ones that pay the least. Some great teachers will suffer through poor pay, but they are not the majority. Schools with low pay tend to lose good teachers to schools with higher pay. If we include the good teachers who leave the profession altogether, instead of moving to a higher-paying school the rate at which schools are getting worse is insane. The amount of people going into education has plummeted. Many of those who do graduate with a degree in education do not make it past 5 years. [The average Teacher turnover rate is over 16% nationwide and getting worse.](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_slc.pdf) Getting good teachers is hard as it is. We are now reaching the point where getting ANYONE to be a teacher is difficult. Every year states lower the bar for the requirements to be a teacher. 

Increasing pay and benefits for teachers at every level give us as a society a much greater chance to retain good and great teachers.

Glad to hear it will likely be addressed.

However, worsening working conditions are a major part of why the demands for more pay have gotten louder. Administrators will side with baseless complaints made by parents because it's seen as the path of least resistance, and teachers are expected to back down from disciplinary measures that are school and district policy, change grades and tolerate behavior that teachers need to be able to shut down in order for a classroom to function.

> Raising teacher pay has become an issue of rare bipartisan consensus, suggested Sanders, who shared initial details of his plan exclusively with USA TODAY ahead of a teacher town hall he is hosting with the country&#039;s largest teachers unions Monday evening.

> Nationally, the average starting salary for a teacher is less than $42,000, while teachers of all levels of experience make about $61,000.

> &quot;If our goal is the best educational system in the world, if our goal is to be able to attract the best and the brightest young people into education, we&#039;re going to have to substantially raise our teacher salary,&quot; Sanders said, pointing to shortages of teachers ravaging some parts of the country.

I suggest the education system look in house and redistribute the wages accordingly 

Then come to taxpayers for more money

Stop knocking on tax payers doors for money when you can tell a superintendent their salary is grossly disproportionate and needs to be adjusted, and do so accordingly


The education system can solve this problem on their own with wage redistribution, the issue is that those people don‚Äôt really care about their coworkers, they need their 6figure bonuses",Ration_L_Thought,2023-02-14,Ireland

Including gov-funding. Because a healthier population is good,kids playing sports instead of getting into trouble is good.
There are No downsides!

Required in schools for sure, all the research shows that more PE and better recesses makes for better results/higher scores.

We have a trend now in my country with recess-activities. Voluntary of course but a teacher/staff has one activity/game organized per recess. And it works really well. Some kids that may otherwise be left out now got something to join. It cuts down on conflicts and it inttoduces new games for the kids.",Senalmoondog,2020-11-23,Ireland

Labor will bin the Recruitment Beyond NSW initiative after just 13 of a promised 560 teachers were attracted to NSW from overseas or interstate.

The scheme had a $14 million budget over four years with $4m committed to a recruiter when it was announced in 2021 ‚Äì meaning the 13 teachers came with a price tag of $300,000 each.

Government documents reveal the program as it stands recruited 11 teachers from overseas, one from Queensland, and one Australian returning from abroad.

Four were recruited from South Africa, three from Zimbabwe, two from the United Kingdom and one each from Singapore and Fiji.

NSW Teachers Federation deputy president Henry Rajendra branded the program ‚Äúan expensive failure‚Äù.

‚ÄúInstead of addressing the real issues causing teacher shortages, which are unsustainable workloads and uncompetitive salaries, the Coalition Government looked for recruiting short cuts that don‚Äôt exist,‚Äù he said.

Former education Minister Sarah Mitchell hit back at Labor‚Äôs election promise to dump the scheme.

‚ÄúI very much stand behind the concept of getting people who are already qualified who lived in other jurisdictions to work in NSW,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúFor Labor to just axe this for what appear to be purely political reasons is a shame and a missed opportunity.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to have different ways to bring other people into the profession if you‚Äôre going to deal with that supply challenge ‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve got to have a pipeline of new teachers coming through.‚Äù

Ms Mitchell had previously said the scheme had received 12,000 expressions of interest from abroad, while adding that visa processing times as long as 18 months had hampered getting teachers into the country and into classrooms.

She added that the Victorian Labor state government had recently started a similar program aimed at recruiting trained teachers to take up ‚Äúhard-to-staff‚Äù positions, which includes $9000 retention payments.

NSW Labor will send the initiative to the scrap heap in favour of a raft of new measures it campaigned on, including removing the wages cap on public sector educators, creating 10,000 new permanent teaching roles, and cutting five hours of admin work a week.

A NSW Government spokeswoman said: ‚ÄúThis is the sort of waste and mismanagement we are inheriting from the former government‚Äù.

‚ÄúFailed programs costing taxpayers millions of dollars. As we continue to receive briefings we are discovering the hidden waste and cost blow outs left behind,‚Äù she said.

Chris Minns‚Äô government will have to contend with soaring numbers of teachers leaving the public education system in recent years, with NSW Department of Education documents revealing 1854 permanent teachers walked away from their jobs last year, up from 929 in 2020.",Jagtom83,2023-04-13,Ireland
