It is not a requirement set by the medical schools council (MSC) or the GMC.


Competition statistics imo are kind of pointless as technically they can vary year on year. So releasing last year's statistics doesn't mean anything if lots more choose to go to Scotland this year, for example.

UKFPO don't know reserve lists until the number of applicants who apply, and those who don't meet the eligibility requirements so after graduation. A student who fails finals is not eligible so UKFPO won't know that number until then. They guarantee everyone who applies a job every year.

To teach in the EU, you typically need to have a passport from an EU member state. EU hiring law is designed to give preference to EU citizens (NOT *native English-speakers*), and employers can't/won't jump through the necessary hoops to hire a non-EU citizen. There are, however, a few ways that non-EU citizens can work legally in the EU, e.g., investing in a Working Holiday Visa (Canadians, Australians, and New Zealanders) or a long-term student visa, or working as a conversation assistant through a programme like *Auxiliares de Conversación* in Spain or TAPIF in France. It is easier to find legal work in Central/Eastern Europe as it's possible to get a freelance visa in countries like Germany, Poland, and Czechia.

1. In line with mandatory safeguarding guidance and the law, parents should automatically be informed when a child discloses feelings of gender distress at school, unless there is a compelling reason for them not to be informed. Parents must be central to any further decision making regarding the handling of a child’s gender distress, including social transition or change of name.   
2. No school should facilitate a child’s social transition (the medical intervention in which a child adopts the social and cultural attributes associated with the opposite sex), unless medical advice clearly endorses this as the best and most appropriate action, and unless parents have been fully involved. Where this situation arises, schools should co-operate fully with relevant external agencies within their local authority.   
3. Schools should be required to publish all Relationships, Sex and Health Education (RSHE) material online, and have a clear process in place for parents to raise any concerns. Parents should be given an absolute right to see all RSHE materials their child will be taught at school. If it is not published online, it must be provided to parents on request, without any requirement for the parent to come on to the school premises. All agencies that provide materials to state-funded schools must accept that materials may be provided to parents in this way.  
4.  The Government must urgently commission an indepent review of the teaching of RSHE materials and approach to gender distressed children in schools, with a focus on safeguarding. The review must be independent and not carried out by the Department for Education (DfE) which has been too closely involved in the development of the current situation.   
5. In line with the law and current guidance, certain activities and facilities should be single sex. This relates to toilets, changing rooms and sports of a competitive nature. There should be no exceptions to this.   
6.  The DfE should update Keeping Children Safe in Education to explicitly address issues relating to children with gender distress and gender dysphoria, emphasising the importance of parental involvement in a child’s life. The document’s statement that LGBT is not a safeguarding issue needs to be removed, given the additional vulnerabilities of the current cohort presenting with gender distress   
7.  The Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) must routinely consider schools’ approach to gender-distressed children as part of its inspection of safeguarding protocols. A school’s failure to meet the appropriate standard should be reflected in the grade Ofsted awards the school, and treated with the same seriousness as other safeguarding failures.  
8.  The DfE should issue guidance on what is not appropriate for schools to be teaching children in RSHE at different stages of a child’s education. Gender stereotypes must be effectively challenged in schools, without conflating beliefs about gender identity with sex. Discussion about gender-critical beliefs should be included.   
9. No state-funded school should subscribe to diversity membership schemes offered by external agencies where such organisations are involved in political campaigning. In accordance with the law, subscription to such schemes constitutes a fundamental conflict of interest. This does not prevent schools from purchasing or using external resources where no conflict arises.

With regards to the former;
For certain mental health conditions to be regarded as a disability (and therefore protected by the EqA2010), yes, an individual would have had to received treatment for it for more than 12 months, but also, if an individual has an assessment by a medical examiner and it's determined that the issue more than likely will last more than 12 months (even if the condition has only been recently diagnosed), then that's also regarded as a disability as it *will* have long term effects. 

The organisation are potentially automatically discriminating against people with mental health conditions that have been diagnosed recently (less than 12 months).

And in regards to the latter, the organisation shouldn't (in my view) have a blanket policy on SSRI, and instead carry out an occupational health assessment on a case by case basis to ensure the employee is capable of carrying out their duties. 

She should speak to HR and ask for the details surrounding the policy and the reason it's there and the rationale for the timeline. (In writing, as always). 

She should then get in touch the [EHRC](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en) and inform them of that policy, because that policy is nothing short than disgraceful regardless of their reasoning. An OHR should be carried out if they have concerns. 
To have a blanket ban is shocking.",Employment_rat,2021-10-16,Ireland

While it's difficult to speculate about what the motivation behind this policy is, as the job involves working with children, safeguarding the children's welfare is a legitimate end, and people with certain mental health conditions might not be safe around children, in which case it might be proportionate to refuse those people employment. However, Sertraline is prescribed for a whole range of mental illnesses most of which wouldn't disqualify you from working with children, so it wouldn't be a proportionate means to a legitimate end on those grounds.

Others in this thread have suggested the side effects of Sertraline might form part of the rationale. However, while sleepiness and fatigue are common side effects (affecting up to 1 in 10 users), you're still allowed to do other tasks that require focused attention - like driving or operating machinery - while taking Sertraline, so again I think this would be doubtful as a justification.

I think if your friend wants to address this, they could ask management for the rationale behind it, and if she's unsatisfied with the answer she could try either challenging it through HR or raising it with ACAS.

You could argue they should have been more on the ball and asked her more questions about the medication straight away, but it's probably not something they come across often.

Noxus is a meritocracy, so being the most powerful guy's assassin means you are one of the best, if not the best. 

As for Draven I recall reading that he is kinda of a celebrity in Noxus. He doesn't have polítical power (well as you said he has ties with Swain and Darius but come on, no one seems to be less interesed in politics than Draven) but he has fame, which is his main goal.

As for Darius I disagree, he only accepted Swain's coup after lentghy conversations and was prepared to bring his warhost into the inmortal bastion. So far we don't know what he agrees and he doesn't agree with, but in the wiki there is a quote saying he really doesn't vibe with the Grey Legion (as he fears he could end up as Sion). Also I believe Swain is not a tyrant, and he chose the other members in the Trifarix cause he truly believes they can keep him in check in case he goes demon crazy. Also if he just wanted figureheads he could literally
just crown himself emperor when he killed Darkwill. Recently I've been reading a lot here that the Trifarix is just Swain and I just don't agree with it.

Teaching Council AND Requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/messianic/comments/10sqyxo/the_jerusalem_council_ruling/,The Jerusalem Council Ruling,"Let's analyze Acts 15 some here, which many maintain abolishes almost the entire Old Testament law was abolished for Christians.  It’s commonly argued that the Jerusalem conference in Acts 15 abolished not just circumcision for gentiles, but the entire Old Testament law.  Advocates of this position will cite Acts 15:5, which mentions what some of the Pharisees who became Christians said concerning having the gentiles circumcised:  “It is necessary to circumcise them, and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses.”  Hence, when the Council decided to set aside circumcision, it’s said that it also set aside the entire Old Testament law code.  The Greek of v. 5, however, indicates this interpretation is unwarranted:  It’s a periphrastic construction, or an intentional roundabout way to say something, which the “and” between the second and third verbs (“direct” and “observe”) strongly suggests.  But even if the linguistic issues are discounted, does anyone plausibly think that the conference in Acts 15 not only abolished the four laws that the anti-Sabbatarians hate (the Sabbath, the Holy Days, tithing, and clean/unclean meat), but the laws against murder, adultery, coveting, idolatry, or theft?   Were the two Great Commandments, which Jesus quoted with approval, trashed as well?  Once again, the anti-Sabbatarians overshoot their mark, since their argument disposes of much too much.  Furthermore, if the entire Law of Moses was obliterated, why are these four laws from the Old Testament singled out as being in force?:  “It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials:  that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well” (Acts 15:28-29).  If Jesus’ death annihilated the entire “Law of Moses” or the entire “Old Covenant,” then why are these four laws retained?  The mere fact that they still exist proves that the Old Testament law wasn’t completely abolished!  Furthermore, when the apostle James announces the final decision of the Council, if he meant to nullify the authority of Moses, why does he say (Acts 15:21):  “For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath”?  Why cite Moses as an authority when you’ve just destroyed his authority?  

Now there was a division in the Jewish community over whether gentiles who desired a relationship with the Eternal had to be circumcised to enter into the covenant community of Israel and thus a relationship with God.  The Pharisees said yes, while the alternative competing interpretation of the law among Jews said no.  It is very important to note that the four prohibitions listed in verses 20, 29 the Jerusalem council chose weren't arbitrarily plucked out of thin air.  These restrictions, based upon Lev. 17-18, were the same four prohibitions this standard alternative  non-Pharisaical interpretation of the law had said should be imposed on the gentiles who wished to convert to Judaism.     
  
All the absurdities flowing from the antinomian interpretation of Acts 15 proves alternatives should be considered.  The conference in Acts 15 was really about what could be called “justification,” or the initial stage of the salvation process.  After all, what set off the entire debate was this assertion:  “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved” (v. 1).  The real dispute was over what gives salvation, not so much over what laws still have to be obeyed intrinsically.  It’s especially important now to realize that the Jews considered circumcision as an initiation rite analogous to what Christians consider baptism’s role in Christianity:  You can’t be a (male) Jew without being circumcised.  This worked fine for those born Jews, but what about adult male converts to Judaism?  (Another problem cropped up concerning those ex-pagans who were circumcised for “the wrong reasons”!)  Previously, before the Acts 15 Council occurred, in Judaism historically near and before the time of Jesus’ death and resurrection, a running debate had festered between different rabbinical schools over which Old Testament laws needed to be imposed on gentile converts of Judaism.  These four laws (listed in vs. 28-29) weren’t randomly plucked from thin air, but were the same ones that the standard alternative non-Pharisaical interpretation of what the law imposed on gentile converts so they could become full members of the covenant community of Israel.  The Pharisees (or at least one of their major schools) believed circumcision had to be added to this list of four requirements (which originates in Lev. 17-18), but their opponents in Judaism felt otherwise.  Actually, all the church did in Acts 15 was to choose the competing interpretation among Jews that denied that gentiles had to be circumcised in order to become converts to the faith.  So when Peter calls some aspect of the law a “yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear,” it shouldn’t be assumed that this was the entire law of Moses.  Again, it’s necessary to note that just because obeying any given law doesn’t justify us, whether it be the law against murder, the law about helping the poor, or the law about tithing, that doesn’t prove no sin is assessed when we violate it or that we don’t still have to obey it.  Since the issue in debate concerned circumcision and the initial stage of the salvation process as Judaism had considered it, it’s wrong to assume that the Acts 15 Council abolished the entire Old Testament law.  

There are further problems with an antinomian interpretation of Acts 15 in an attempt to prove radical discontinuity in the law Christians still must obey.  To say that this conference ended the authority of the writings of Moses on Christians runs headlong into the raw fact James, who summarizes the conference's decision, first cites Old Testament prophet Amos (in verses 16-18) and then Moses's authority more obliquely (v. 21)  to justify his decision.  Nothing from the words of Christ or about His (alleged) role in ending the law by His sacrifice is mentioned.  As Bacchiocchi observed:  ""\[H\]ow can the authority of Moses be negated when the four ritual laws are drawn from Moses himself (Lev 17-18)?""   When Peter mentioned in v. 10 the ""placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our father nor we have been able to bear"" the issue was circumcision, not the authority of the Torah, which had earlier been called ""living \[not dead\] oracles to pass on to you"" in Acts 7:38.  Note that Peter doesn't identify directly what this ""yoke"" is in his speech as it is recorded in Acts 15.  One must avoid assuming the ""yoke"" was ""the law of Moses"" as opposed to ""being circumcised as an adult,"" which would make it an attack on the traditional Pharisaical view that adult gentiles should submit to circumcision based on their interpretation of Ex. 12:48.    

  
Now let's turn to Acts 21:25, which antinomians use to prove that only these four restrictions listed in Acts 15:20, 29 are still binding out of the law of Moses.   The context of this restatement of the Jerusalem Council's decision is a request of Paul by James and the elders of the Jerusalem church to undergo a purification ritual to squelch the rumor among Christians that he was telling gentiles not to circumcise their children and to forsake Moses.  These Jewish Christians were ""all zealous for the Law"" (v. 20).  He was to show that he himself ""also walk\[ed\] orderly, keeping the law""  (v. 24) by doing so.  Then comes the key verse (NKJV, v. 25):  ""But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written and decided that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality.""  The words underlined are found in the received text used by the NKJV and KJV, but not in the Greek text that underlies most modern Bible translations, the Westcott-Hort/?critical"" text.   The Greek words  (ei mi) translated ""except"" here can also mean ""but,"" ""only,"" or even ""rather"" or ""instead.""  The issue comes down to what the antecedent ""no such thing"" refers back to.  The antinomian viewpoint would be it refers to the purification rites that Paul was asked to go through to settle the concerns of the Jewish Christians he was preaching against the law.  However, we're back to the same problems already stated above, in which even the Two Great Commandments, not just the Ten Commandments, are considered to be abolished.  It's absurd on its face.",snoweric,2023-02-03,Ireland

It's pretty cool the originator even called them out on they would do it, before they've done anything. Sort of letting them know he knows how they play the game. They can claim the brethren were given bad advice. Okay.....that's possible. But let's not forget, the entire point of them asking for assistance/advice was TO HIDE ASSETS FROM THE PUBLIC AND THE MEMBERS. It's one thing to realize you were filing taxes wrong based on some really bad advice. That's an honest mistake. It happens. And there are fines and penalties associated if you get caught/audited. But THAT is completely different than wantonly trying to hide assets. It's an apples and oranges comparison and this was NOT an honest mistake. It's 100% rooted in trying to hide assets.

The traditional, (and I believe to be wrong), TBM interpretation is that the President of the Church is infallible, as He would otherwise be 'taken out of his place' by the Lord for going astray.  
   
However, an alternative interpretation is, members who have the Spirit will never be led astray by an errant President because *they* would not follow him off-course. (Rich, selfish, and money-obsessed General Authorities may let go of the Iron Rod and wander toward the Great & Spacious Building, but for me and my house, we will serve the Lord).

I was the kid who was the deacons quorum president and then immediately the teachers quorum president. I always questioned the bullshit they taught about Joseph smith and the 3 kingdoms, but never new it was all a lie. About 8 months ago, we moved to the city my exmo cousin lived in. He got me into mountain biking, and as you would figure, that gives you a lot of time in the car alone. Basically he added a ton of weight to my shelf, and it started to crack. Then he pointed me towards the CES letters which changed my life. My shelf snapped the night I read that book.  I’m now exmo, and not sure where to go with my life.

Which would have been after the word “accountable.”  

Also, explicitly missing in this guys diatribe - is the accountability for apostles, presiding bishop etc (q15).  He’s accused the q15, but they aren’t held to account according to their own rules cited.  

That’s why I’ve been asking Mormons what they would do if satan slipped into one of their apostles like he so easily did back in Jesus day. 

There’s nothing they can do - they can’t discern up from down and neither can the q15.  If a member of the q15 sneaks in as a mole or perhaps is possessed by satan, there’s nothing anyone can do about it.  If all the q15 decided to walk away with the money, they easily could and there’s also nothing that could be done about it.

EDIT for serious discussion: Erik has one of my favorite stories on Survivor ever, a fan that lost at the final five due to his mistakes and lost again years later due to something out of his hands. I know he wasn’t fond of his second appearance and the treatment of most of the cast in that season, and I concur as 26 is one of my least favorite seasons in the entire show. But he remains one of my favorite contestants and I’m glad to see he still participates in the sub, despite all the drama with his failed project. His comics are pretty great if anyone watching the show hasn’t seen them. 

Thanks for the write up OP!

Teaching Council AND Requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateACatholic/comments/xuvh99/pope_francis_has_changed_church_teaching_on_the/,"Pope Francis has changed Church teaching on the death penalty, and it is not merely a prudential change","Hello – I enjoyed your well-crafted post and had a few thoughts I would like to share. I must confess this is a topic I have not previously discussed and have little experience with, meaning this is a process of wandering discovery on my part, and so I apologise for that in advance.

My first uncertainty was ‘precisely what has the Church taught regarding the death penalty?’: that it was permissible, but under which criteria? To conclude on whether dogma has changed, the clearest definition of the dogma is critical. I thought of Augustine and complexities of just war theory, and so wondering if he might have a just-capital-punishment theory, began there.

#Augustine – 426 A.D.

City of God, Book I, Chapter 21:

>But the divine authority itself has made certain exceptions to the rule that it is not lawful to kill men. These exceptions, however, include only those whom God commands to be slain, either by a general law, or by an express command applying to a particular person at a particular time. Moreover, he who is commanded to perform this ministry does not himself slay. Rather, he is like a sword which is the instrument of its user. And so those who, by God's authority, have waged wars, or who, bearing the public power in their own person, have punished the wicked with death according to His laws, that is, by His most just authority: these have in no way acted against that commandment which says, 'Thou shalt not kill.'

The chapter is titled ‘of those cases of homicide which do not incur the guilt of murder’. This, to me, is less a defence of execution, and is more concerned with the question of whether those who are unfortunately commanded to be the agent of execution are themselves guilty of sin. Augustine lists war directly alongside execution: Augustine's intent was to exonerate the soldier and executioner, not to advocate for war and execution (which will be touched upon later).

Augustine famously argued that war may be justified, a position the Church adopted, but with your first premise in mind, this would never be taken to mean ‘war can never be morally illicit’; the opposite is the case, with just war being the rare exception, the infrequent anomaly. 

Bearing in mind that Augustine believed the two spheres of homicide to be so interlinked that he listed them alongside one another, what one might consider ‘exceptions to the fifth commandment’, if Francis issued a statement that war is contrary to the Gospel and declared war ‘inadmissible’ in the modern era, would this be too regarded as a controversial alteration of fundamental Church teaching?

While in 426 A.D. it could not be said that there had yet emerged ‘dogma’ regarding exceptions to the fifth commandment, the fledgling position appears to have been ‘I [Augustine] believe lawful soldiers and executioners are not guilty of murder when acting under the conditional circumstances which warrant exception to the fifth commandment and thus render their war or execution just.’

#Catechism of the Council of Trent – 1566 A.D.

As an ecumenical council, Trent held extraordinary magisterial authority. This infallibility did not extend to the catechism published several years later; however, the authority of the Trent catechism bears considerable weight. It was intended to instruct parish priests on how to catechise their congregation, with Part III concerning the decalogue.

The fifth commandment, ‘Thou shalt not kill’, has a subsection detailing prohibitory exceptions to this commandment. After excusing the killing of animals (which cites Augustine, indicating his influence in ‘fifth commandment exclusions’), the text states:

>Another kind of lawful slaying belongs to the civil authorities, to whom is entrusted power of life and death, by the legal and judicious exercise of which they punish the guilty and protect the innocent. The just use of this power, far from involving the crime of murder, is an act of paramount obedience to this Commandment which prohibits murder. The end of the Commandment is the preservation and security of human life. Now the punishments inflicted by the civil authority, which is the legitimate avenger of crime, naturally tend to this end, since they give security to life by repressing outrage and violence.

This may be, I believe, the most compelling argument for the claim that the Church advocated for execution. As with Augustine, the primary concern appeared to be exonerating executioners of sin, but unlike Augustine, there is no association with the horror of war. That is, until the paragraph immediately afterwards:

>In like manner, the soldier is guiltless who, actuated not by motives of ambition or cruelty, but by a pure desire of serving the interests of his country, takes away the life of an enemy in a just war.

Further text states that ‘the above are the cases in which life may be taken without violating this Commandment’, with ‘may’ being a key word: the soldier who acts ‘not by motives of ambition or cruelty’ is sinless, while the cruel soldier sins; likewise, if ‘just use of this power [execution]’ is sinless, unjust execution must then be rooted in sin. In both instances of homicide, whether legitimate exception to the fifth commandment is present is highly conditional.

This leads to the dogmatic position of ‘the Church declares lawful soldiers and executioners are not guilty of murder when acting under the conditional circumstances which warrant exception to the fifth commandment and thus render their war or execution just.’

#Pius X – 1908 A.D.

From the Catechism of Saint Pius X, Chapter ‘On the Commandments of God and the Church’, Subchapter ‘The Fifth Commandment’, Question 3:

>Q. Are there cases in which it is lawful to kill?

>A. It is lawful to kill when fighting in a just war; when carrying out by order of the Supreme Authority a sentence of death in punishment of a crime; and, finally, in cases of necessary and lawful defence of one's own life against an unjust aggressor.

Yet again is this link between just war and just execution. The term ‘Supreme Authority’ is a curious one, as it does not appear elsewhere within the text. One might naturally assume this to mean God, but within canon law ‘supreme authority’ has been considered the realm of the Church ([link](https://www.vatican.va/archive/cod-iuris-canonici/eng/documents/cic_lib2-cann330-367_en.html)), with Pius X himself having stated that supreme authority rests with the Magisterium in prior writings ([link](https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-x/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-x_enc_11021906_vehementer-nos.html); paragraph 13).

While this is speculatory on my part, considering Pius X’s condemnation of separation between Church and state, I believe this was a hardening of the former ‘civil authorities may perform just executions’ into ‘the Church alone has authority to determine whether war or execution is just’. This itself would not constitute a change in teaching, because interpretations of exceptions to the fifth commandment (i.e. just war and just execution) had been the dominion of the Church for 1900 years prior to then, but it removed any apparent ambiguity in whether a civil court can perform just executions contrary to the will of the Church.

It may be said that, at this point, the dogma was ‘the Church declares lawful soldiers and executioners not guilty of murder when the Church has determined their war or execution to be just.’

#Francis – 2018 A.D.

From *Fratelli Tutti* you quoted paragraph 255, then proceeded to paragraph 263. This section as a whole was titled ‘WAR AND THE DEATH PENALTY’, with chapters 256-262 titled ‘The injustice of war’, suggesting that like Augustine, Trent, and Pius X, Francis considers these spheres of homicide interlinked. I believe understanding Francis’ position on war is essential to understanding his position on execution. Chapter 258 states:

>War can easily be chosen by invoking all sorts of allegedly humanitarian, defensive or precautionary excuses, and even resorting to the manipulation of information. In recent decades, every single war has been ostensibly “justified”. The Catechism of the Catholic Church speaks of the possibility of legitimate defence by means of military force, which involves demonstrating that certain “rigorous conditions of moral legitimacy” have been met. Yet it is easy to fall into an overly broad interpretation of this potential right. In this way, some would also wrongly justify even “preventive” attacks or acts of war that can hardly avoid entailing “evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated”. At issue is whether the development of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and the enormous and growing possibilities offered by new technologies, have granted war an uncontrollable destructive power over great numbers of innocent civilians. The truth is that “never has humanity had such power over itself, yet nothing ensures that it will be used wisely”. We can no longer think of war as a solution, because its risks will probably always be greater than its supposed benefits. In view of this, it is very difficult nowadays to invoke the rational criteria elaborated in earlier centuries to speak of the possibility of a “just war”. Never again war!

Francis has an extremely pessimistic view towards war. If asked, Francis would doubtlessly consider war to be an ‘abasement to human dignity’ and ‘contrary to the Gospel’, as perhaps would Augustine, since Francis’ source for ‘never again war!’ is none other than Augustine, who, despite being the father of just war theory, abhorred war and [sought its end](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102229.htm):

>But it is a higher glory still to stay war itself with a word, than to slay men with the sword, and to procure or maintain peace by peace, not by war. For those who fight, if they are good men, doubtless seek for peace; nevertheless it is through blood. Your mission, however, is to prevent the shedding of blood.",XPISTI,2022-10-04,Ireland

Perhaps the death penalty may be just, in principle. But is it charitable? Perhaps the death penalty is admissible as a matter of justice. But is it admissible as a matter of charity? Saying something is moral and immoral can mean different things: spousal rape from the standpoint of sexual virtue is actually not sinful. But is it sinful from a different angle, such as from the standpoint of justice, let alone charity? Perhaps anger can be virtuous and justified. But is it something a Saint should possess?

[I think agree with John Paul II and Francis in principle that if we can secure the lives of criminals without killing them, we should.](https://zippycatholic.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/blessed-pope-john-paul-ii-on-the-death-penalty-less-development-than-meets-the-eye/) That said, I don’t think that the current prison system actually secures the lives of criminals themselves. Because, here’s the thing: if prisoners have inalienable dignity, just like Francis says, which means that the state is also obligated to *secure their lives* from assault and rape *even if they are in prison.* And I’m sorry, the current system in the West simply does not do this, and the prudential judgement otherwise actually tends to be blind to this, functionally denying the very dignity of prisoners that it intends to defend.

And I haven’t even gotten to other issues in the prison system either: is the way we treat prisoners actually good, or do just hide our violence against criminals just because it is clinical and psychological. Perhaps we should not act like locking people up is non-violent, because being trapped in a cage is a kind of violence too.",LucretiusOfDreams,2022-10-05,Ireland

Since you have no idea what this allegation is its going to next to impossible to find some one with insight.    
  
So the best course of action is to NOT SAY A FREAKING WORD during the meeting. Just go in and hear what they have to say and write down the questions they ask.  Record if able.   
  
This is a classic case (in my opinion) of admins trying to justify an allegation rather than investigating it.  Whatever you say will be skewed to meet what ever narrative they want.  

If you meet the requirements to get your certification they can't hold if from you, unless some clause gives them the right.  After this meeting (where I hope you don't tell them SHIT) you'll should have the allegation against you laid out. Than you move forward with legal action if required.  
 
You have the legal right, even in administrative inquires, to not answer questions.
  
EDIT:

Additionally, this could have some personal legal implications. Perhaps the admins are sitting on a felony and are trying to see how you answer their questions before they file with the authorities.  ",Bestoftherest222,2017-05-27,Ireland

In addition, I have worked at the university teaching students working towards teacher certification and while I do not know your particular university to confirm I can say that you can definitely be denied your teacher certificate and not be kicked out or fail to graduate. It is rare but it does happen. It sounds like you may not meet the minimum GPA requirements. If this is the case you can ask to repeat the course for a higher grade in order to gain your teacher certificate.

I think you should definitely call/email and press for details about this meeting so that you can prepare. You are also within your rights to listen to the allegations and then ask to set up another meeting at a future date so that you can gather the documentation to refute the claim.

After talking with friends who are in my program and who are licensed teachers, the consensus is that any ""allegations"" could not be formally made (I would have heard from the department of ed, not from the school) and that if there had been an inclination of any ""disturbing"" behavior egregious enough to prevent me from getting my teaching certification I would have been removed from the school rather than completing my teaching and testing before being told I would not be recommended.

This isn't clear to me.  Are they saying there's nothing they can think of that would prompt this kind of allegation/investigation, or are they saying that in their opinion no one could make these allegations because of technicalities?

Have any of your fellow students been able to come up with anything they think might be the cause of these disturbing allegations?  Do you have any idea what this is all about?

They wouldn't have a secret librarian teaching a high school student. They wouldn't have a Slayer working a day job. The Slayer wouldn't be solo, there'd be a team of trained soldiers/magic-users backing her up. People training her in strategy, tactics, martial arts, philosophy, demonology, everything she needs.

But I also think a lot of this is answered in universe. Buffy is an anomaly amongst slayers. Typically the Watchers Council has a good hold on potentials and they begin their training early. We see this with Kendra, who has a Slayer Handbook and a lot of tactical, weapons, history, and demon knowledge. Buffy was a potential that slipped through the cracks.  

Magic also seems to rely on some innate talent. There are definitely those that possess more natural talent than others (like Willow and Amy), but not just anyone can learn magic. 

As for the Watchers Council and why there is only one Slayer: When the first Slayer was created, the world was much smaller. From a real historical perspective we know that no one living in ancient times could have imagined the world as it is today. She was also imbued with the strength of an Old One, so by the time the world had grown and changed, there were no Old Ones left and no way to change the Slayers powers. The reason that Willow was able to activate all Slayers where the Watchers Council couldn’t is because she is one of the most powerful forces on earth, all the council combined doesn’t compare to her. The council also really views the Slayer as just a tool. They never expected or wanted the Slayer to take everything on, it was supposed to be their plan with Slayer following along and doing as told. Buffy is just...difficult. Her turning her back on the council was unprecedented. 

I think there are a lot of parallels between the Watchers Council and the British Men of Letters from Supernatural.

I do understand your point. Wolfham & Hart, and other 'all big bad' in the Buffy/Angel universe makes it feel like there is anything good to watch out for earth/human-kind/etc. Powers that Be? - they continually seem to be of little help. Everyone boast it's not about winning or losing, but not sure how evil always has the upper hand... and it's not fair to expect one girl to be the answer. Heck, LA was going through daily shiz-storms of doom, if not for Angel Investigations, what would happen? Also, Wolfham and Hart have branches in major cities everywhere, so like is every city trying to bring on an apocalypse? If there is a hellmouth in Cleveland (must explain the Browns continued failure), who handles the weekly pending doom there?  If only one slayer (whether to be a tool in fight against evil, the symbol of all good in humanity, etc etc), and she's in a hellmouth of her own. The logistics of your 'world saving secret organization' sucks. The people, aren't much to write home about. What do they do? A pool of watchers mean they know who potential slayers are. Why train them if they never get activated? Do they not know the order of activation? Why not send all potential to central training? Why did Buffy start out so unprepared compared to Kendra, and some of the other potientials who had watchers.

Paul continued being a Jew, he went up to the temple and attended the synagogue; there's almost no page in Paul's writings without some allusion or quotation of the Jewish scriptures.

Paul does teach to the gentiles that they're not saved by the Law, but the gentiles were not part of the covenant; Jesus didn't teach otherwise, and Judaism doesn't either. Furthermore, Paul teaches gentile converts to adhere to the morality of the Law (""*Love one another, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law*"" - Romans 13:8), as they have been grafted onto Judaism and by such they will be judged (Romans 11:17:30). 

>This would not be necessary if everyone accepted his authority.

He wasn't a disciple of Jesus during his life, not one of the twelve so that easily explains why not everyone would accept his authority.

Teaching Council AND Requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/126k7vt/paul_does_not_represent_the_views_of_jesus/,Paul does not represent the views of Jesus,"This kind of reasoning (i.e., ""Jesus' religion was different from Paul's"") was long ago rebutted in detail by J. Gresham Machen's ""The Origin of Paul's Religion"" (1921). There's nothing new in these kinds of arguments; they have endlessly been rebutted by conservative Christian scholars. I would suggest by quoting from Machen's century-old book and then rebutting them, if one is to be at all persuasive to an informed opposition.  
  
A key prop of such arguments is to argue that Paul's view of the law was difference from Jesus', which I would deny as a Christian who keeps the seventh-day Sabbath, observes the holy days listed in Leviticus 23, pays tithes, and avoids eating unclean meat.  
  
Paul made many pro-law statements (Rom. 3:31; 7:12, 22; 8:7; 13:9), and quoted from the Old Testament law as an authority. Paul sees the law as a guide to identifying correct conduct, such as in Rom. 7:7 (Williams translation): ""What are we then to conclude? Is the law sin? Of course not! Yet, if it had not been for the law, I should not have learned what sin was, for I should not have known what an evil desire was, if the law had not said, 'You must not have an evil desire.'” But for Paul neither the law nor obedience to it was the source of justification (setting aside the issues raised by Rom. 2:13), which was the main point of his letter to the Galatians. In order to reconcile some of Paul's seemingly contradictory statements on the law, it's necessary also to remember the distinction between the moral law, such as found in the Ten Commandments, which is still in force, and ritualistic/ceremonial laws, such as circumcision and the animal sacrifices, which are no longer in force (I Cor. 7:19).  
  
The Apostle Paul surely taught that inward saving faith must manifest outward good works, or else it's bogus (Rom. 2:13): “For not the hearers of the Law are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.” Paul clearly proclaimed that Christians in a state of grace should avoid a life of sin (Rom. 6:1-2, 15): “What shall we say then? Are we to continue to sin that grace might increase? May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it? . . . What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be!”  
  
Sure, it has been commonly argued that the Jerusalem conference in Acts 15 abolished not just circumcision for gentiles, but the entire Old Testament law. Advocates of this position will cite Acts 15:5, which mentions what some of the Pharisees who became Christians said concerning having the gentiles circumcised: “It is necessary to circumcise them, and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses.” Hence, when the Council decided to set aside circumcision, it’s said that it also set aside the entire Old Testament law code. The Greek of v. 5, however, indicates this interpretation is unwarranted: It’s a periphrastic construction, or an intentional roundabout way to say something, which the “and” between the second and third verbs (“direct” and “observe”) strongly suggests. But even if the linguistic issues are discounted, does anyone plausibly think that the conference in Acts 15 not only abolished the four laws that the antinomians oppose (the Sabbath, the Holy Days, tithing, and clean/unclean meat), but the laws against murder, adultery, coveting, idolatry, or theft? Were the two Great Commandments, which Jesus quoted with approval, trashed as well? Once again, the antinomians overshoot their mark, since their argument disposes of much too much. Furthermore, if the entire Law of Moses was obliterated, why are these four laws from the Old Testament singled out as being in force?: “It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials: that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well” (Acts 15:28-29). If Jesus’ death annihilated the entire “Law of Moses” or the entire “Old Covenant,” then why are these four laws retained? The mere fact that they still exist proves that the Old Testament law wasn’t completely abolished! Furthermore, when the apostle James announces the final decision of the Council, if he meant to nullify the authority of Moses, why does he say (Acts 15:21): “For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath”? Why cite Moses as an authority when you’ve just destroyed his authority?  
  
All the absurdities flowing from the antinomian interpretation of Acts 15 proves alternatives should be considered. The conference in Acts 15 was really about what could be called “justification,” or the initial stage of the salvation process. After all, what set off the entire debate was this assertion: “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved” (v. 1). The real dispute was over what gives salvation, not so much over what laws still have to be obeyed intrinsically. It’s especially important now to realize that the Jews considered circumcision as an initiation rite analogous to what Christians consider baptism’s role in Christianity: You can’t be a (male) Jew without being circumcised. This worked fine for those born Jews, but what about adult male converts to Judaism? (Another problem cropped up concerning those ex-pagans who were circumcised for “the wrong reasons”!) Previously, before the Acts 15 Council occurred, in Judaism historically near and before the time of Jesus’ death and resurrection, a running debate had festered between different rabbinical schools over which Old Testament laws needed to be imposed on gentile converts of Judaism. These four laws (listed in vs. 28-29) weren’t randomly plucked from thin air, but were the same ones that the standard alternative non-Pharisaical interpretation of what the law imposed on gentile converts so they could become full members of the covenant community of Israel. The Pharisees (or at least one of their major schools) believed circumcision had to be added to this list of four requirements (which originates in Lev. 17-18), but their opponents in Judaism felt otherwise. Actually, all the church did in Acts 15 was to choose the competing interpretation among Jews that denied that gentiles had to be circumcised in order to become converts to the faith. So when Peter calls some aspect of the law a “yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear,” it shouldn’t be assumed that this was the entire law of Moses. Again, it’s necessary to note that just because obeying any given law doesn’t justify us, whether it be the law against murder, the law about helping the poor, or the law about tithing, that doesn’t prove no sin is assessed when we violate it or that we don’t still have to obey it. Since the issue in debate concerned circumcision and the initial stage of the salvation process as Judaism had considered it, it’s wrong to assume that the Acts 15 Council abolished the entire Old Testament law.

Did Paul get the term ""Lord"" from paganism?  The scholar Bousset claimed that Paul's use of the term ""Lord"" came from the Hellenistic Jewish churches in Antioch, Tarsus, and maybe Damascus that paganism had influenced more than the mother Jerusalem church.  Ridderbos dismissed such reasoning as “for the most part no longer acceptable to most scholars, and the attempt of Bultmann to give new life to it can hardly be viewed as successful.”  Numerous problems upset Bousset's thesis, as Machen explains.  For example, why it is assumed that Antioch’s primitive Christianity differed greatly from Jerusalem’s?  As for the origin of the term ""Lord"" in early Christianity, solid evidence supports its early use in Judea.  Paul's use of the Aramaic expression, Maranatha, meaning (I Cor. 15:22, NASB margin), ""O \[our\] Lord come!"" is an unlikely flower to spring up from non-Semitic, Hellenistic soil.  While explaining the implications of Maranatha, Nock comments that it couldn’t have come from the use of kyrios for pagan gods or the Roman emperor:  “That the Greek designation should come from the Aramaic is infinitely more probable than that a Gentile description of Jesus as Kyrios should be translated back into Aramaic in time for St. Paul to find it \[in Antioch\] existing as a fixed liturgical or quasi-liturgical term.”  Nock insightfully notes how early the Greek terminology was entrenched among Christians, since the Eucharist is call the Lord’s Supper, Kyriakon deipnon, in I Cor. 11:20.  Even the Gospels have cases in which Jesus was called ""Lord"" in a manner that surely exceeds the polite formal form of address, ""sir.""  In Mark 11:3, Jesus uses it to refer to Himself:  ""And if anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' you say, 'The Lord has need of it'; and immediately he will send it back here.""  In Matt. 7:21 (cf. the parallel in Luke 6:46), Jesus proclaimed:  ""Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven.""",snoweric,2023-03-31,Ireland

It was started by John the baptizer. One of his disciples was Jesus of Nazareth, who became a prominent person in the movement. When John died, Jesus took over most of the movement.

This is a rather fantastical view of the narrative in the Gospels, with little to no connection to what is said therein. John's consistent position throughout the Gospels narratives, and *entirely without exception* is the superiority of Jesus to himself. There are *exactly* 4 extant sources of information on the relationship between the two and *all* agree on this point. 

cf 

John 1:23 John said, “**I am the voice of one shouting in the wilderness**, ‘Make straight the way **for the Lord**’

John 3:27 John replied, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven. **28 You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but rather, ‘I have been sent before him.’** 29 The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. **The friend of the bridegroom, who stands by and listens for him, rejoices greatly when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. This then is my joy, and it is complete**. 30 **He must become more important while I become less important**.”

The baptism narratives of Jesus in the synoptics are further evidence against this claim. It cannot be reasonably argued that Matthew and Luke exhibit literary dependence upon Mark in **this** narrative, as it breaks the normative pattern of Mark having the most detailed explanation of the event. Luke and Matthew are quite a bit more verbose here, and differently so. None contradict the other, but neither can Luke and Matthew be portrayed as relying on Mark (nor Luke Matthew)

So your assertion about Jesus being a disciple of John is false. Your assertion about Jesus rising to prominence after John's death is false.

>Contrary to the Epistle of James, Paul preaches justification by faith rather than works of the law (Galatians 2:16, Romans 3:28)

You neither understand Paul's point nor James'. 

James is saying that true faith cannot exist absent of change in behavior and action.

Paul's point is that soteriology *depends not* on our action, but in believing loyalty to God through the Messiah. This standard is *in no way* novel. Paul goes into excruciating detail on the consistency of this with the narrative of the Tanakh.

Paul then **goes on make the same point as James** in Romans 6! 

* 6:1 What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase? 2 Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? 

* 12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires, 13 and do not present your members to sin as instruments to be used for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead and your members to God as instruments to be used for righteousness.

* 15 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? **Absolutely not!** 16 Do you not know that if you present yourselves as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or obedience resulting in righteousness?

*  17 But thanks be to God that though you were slaves to sin, **you obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching you were entrusted to, 18 and having been freed from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness**.

So I find that at *every* point here, your post fails to adequately portray the biblical narrative.",NoSheDidntSayThat,2023-03-30,Ireland
Teaching Council AND Requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/126k7vt/paul_does_not_represent_the_views_of_jesus/,Paul does not represent the views of Jesus,"I will be up front and say I did not even attempt to read this entire post today.  Looks like one of mine for which I apologize for the length when I do type it.

That said, to say that ""Paul does not represent the views of Jesus"" (your title) is utterly false.

Paul (originally Saul) was converted BY Jesus in Acts 9.  This wasn't Jesus choosing a disciple whom he knew was false.  This was a literal conversion where Saul was born again.

The main thing I want to point out is that you clearly do not understand dispensationalism in the scriptures.  God chose to use Paul to bring in the dispensation of grace to the entire world where the gospel formerly was primarily to the Jews.  Jesus even said this would happen as he ascended into heaven at the end of Matthew.

You need to understand there are different dispensations or dividings of times.  While Jesus was here on Earth, before the crucifixion, he preached the gospel of the kingdom, same as John the Baptist.  That same gospel of the kingdom will later be preached during the great tribulation by the 144,000.  God used Paul as the primary (not the only) apostle to transition into the dispensation of grace.  The message is very similar but not identical.

Without understanding dispensations, and without the Holy Spirit in your heart to guide and teach you, you CANNOT understand scripture.  Be sure you are born again, according to 1 John (by the way, John <> Paul, so that's not going to fall within your argument of what you want to call false scripture/doctrine).

Also note that Paul had MANY attempt to write things in his name.  If you find some other work outside of the Bible, do not put that on the same footing in your study.  The Bible is literally the Word of God.  There were many people while Paul was alive who wrote unbiblical things, claiming to be from Paul.",gvlpc,2023-03-30,Ireland

Many demons and witches know magic and Slayers have no defense.,"The Council is all about upholding the status quo. They’re essentially fighting a war that is destined to go on forever, a war that gives their existence meaning. They don’t want to or don’t think they can ever “win” against evil. To the Council, the eternal cycle of Slayer is called, Slayer fights, Slayer dies, next Slayer is called is just the way things are, the way they always have been and the way they always will be. 

The Slayer is just a pawn to them. She exists to stop the evil side from getting too out of hand, but they don’t want her to ever get so powerful that she could tip the scales too far either way. They don’t want her to get so powerful that she outgrows them or could destroy them. They want to control and own the Slayer, and we see over and over again that magic is extremely powerful, reality-bendingly powerful, so it’s in their best interests that no Slayer ever really learn how to harness it. 

This is why Buffy is so powerful and the end of the series demonstrates it perfectly: she defies the destiny of “Slayer fights and dies alone” by sharing her power with others. The Council probably always had the power to activate all the potentials, but they either chose not to or it didn’t even occur to them to do it.",DizzyKnowing,2020-08-13,Ireland

Many demons and witches know magic and Slayers have no defense.,"I can't find a post about Faith, but I really wanna rant about Faiths development in Season 4.  She became buffy at first for vengeance. But then, we see her save a girl and see it cause her to feel something. And her realization that Riley wasn't just using Buffy and was in love with her. She seemed genuinely confused and actually seemed to -concerned- about Buffy (""what do you want with H-her?"")

 her development through the episode seems to imply she wants to BE Buffy, and actually starts to believe she IS. She gets incredibly defensive when Forrest calls her a killer and says she's the slayer, he doesn't know her. She was definitely struggling with who she was in the end.. And her battle with Buffy in the church was so sad. Punching Buffy over and over, hysterical. (""YOU'RE DISGUSTING, MURDEROUS BITCH"") i believe she was dealing with some serious self hatred in this moment, hitting herself and screaming, because she's seen who she was from another perspective, and seen how kind people are. And she wants to be like that. And when she first saw the news cast about the people in the church... No hesitation. She went to help them. Her actions were VERY Buffy like, like she wasn't just acting anymore. It's who she became.

 Then Buffy switches back, and Faith runs in shame. We see a different side to her, her internal struggle to be good and fail. I hate it's never mentioned or talked about. The Scooby gang all go back to being like ""lol Faith, crazy murderous slut"" I'm sorry for ranting but omg, watching this episode and seeing this. I hated how she struggled and it's never acknowledged....


To make this somewhat relevant, the Watchers Council was horrible and Faith could have turned out so much better if they hadn't made her feel like killing the assistant mayor made her a complete irredeemable monster. Faith had a horrible life, clearly had an abusive mother, was used by guys, and decided to do the same to them. I don't think she believed in love other than her father-daughter relationship with the Mayor, and I wish she could've had a better ending. But every time we see her, things get worse and worse. Her actions were inexcusable, but the watchers council small minded ways made it even worse. And resulted in her joining the mayor because no one else would accept her. Or, atleast that's how the Council made her feel. In conclusion, the council are the real monsters",BookWormWolf888,2020-08-13,Ireland

The reality is they want her to be malleable and gullible so they can easily control her. Buffy doesn't let that happen and see how they react. Faith has pretty much gone rogue. Pre season 7, the best case scenario for the WC was that both Faith and Buffy died to start fresh with a brand new Slayer.

They could also activate all potentials to have more Slayers fighting evil - but they don't because one girl is easier to control than thousands.

The WC does not care about the Slayer's safety or well-being. She is a tool to them, a disposable one. If they viewed her any differently, Slayers would have a higher life expectancy, and they would not, for a start, expose her to danger themselves by taking away her strength then pitting her against a vampire when - IF - she turns 18.

If you look at the ballot measures that LA county voters voted for in the 1920s, they embraced more roads for cars by voting for the 1924 Major Traffic Street Plan of Los Angeles and rejected the elevated track plan or to subsidize transit service.

You keep on saying that Americans did not have a choice and that officials made these decisions against the wishes of the American public. But, in LA, at least, voters did have a choice and they chose cars over the trolleys back in the 1920s.",NotThatJosh,2023-04-03,Ireland

I do think that Holland's past statements and the church's continued policies towards the LGBTQ+ community should have precluded him from being invited to begin with. That's on the university, and the students should hold them responsible. Probably the most effective means of protesting that would be non-attendance and assembling elsewhere for am alternative assembly. Disrupting the proceeding or making a spectacle in front of the venue is counter productive. It may scratch an itch to fight the righteous fight, but ultimately causes more harm than good. Empty chairs is a louder message than chants and banners.

Public universities have a duty to the well being of their students, and inviting someone who has a history of attacking an especially vulnerable population is irresponsible. There is a line between arguing ideas and promoting dogmas designed for cultural marginalization. Limited government and the free markets are ideas in the public square. Identifying a population of people and creating a doctrine, for which there is no evidence, that excludes them from society or suggests their elimination all together is better labeled ideology. The latter has no place in the academy, especially a secular academy. The administration showed poor judgement here.

The other reason I don't think this is a speech issue is that Holland wouldn't be silenced even if he were uninvited. The church owns media and broadcasting companies. They have their own newspaper. They publish literature in the millions of copies and have people dedicated to taking that literature door to door if necessary. Twice a year Elder Holland speaks to a world audience in a conference that is beamed into every home and ward building along with translation services as required. His words are then transcribed, published, and publicized by a professional marketing and media team. The only thing Holland would lose by not speaking at a public university is a captive audience who doesn't want to hear from him.

At the same time, I don't think Holland is tone deaf. I don't think he'd even mention controversial topics or dogma. It's all about the weight of his past and who he represents that's the problem.",Oliver_DeNom,2023-03-23,Ireland

&#x200B;

1: There is a difference between inviting a speaker to come give a talk on campus, and inviting a speaker to give a commencement address. Most university campuses have dozens, if not hundreds, of visiting speakers every year. In my view, any group on campus should be able to invite anyone they want to come and speak, and that speaker should be allowed to talk. Commencement is special in that it's meant to be a unifying and inspiring coda to the college experience; it is not just another forum in which scientific results, academic perspectives, or political arguments can be made. Its purpose is not to spark debate. Those tasked with selecting commencement speakers have a very different job from those tasked with inviting regular seminar speakers. There will be many of the latter; there is only one of the former in a given year. In the present time, inviting someone who has a known record of advocating for the restrictions of rights for LGBT people is just an immensely insensitive and stupid decision, since LGBT folks will be among those graduating. It's not about free speech; it's about whether you want the commencement experience to be pleasant for everyone involved. For the same reason, nobody should be giving commencement addresses if they're on record advocating for racial segregation, repeal of women's rights to vote, etc. If some group wants to host those speakers for a seminar, fine. But not commencement. Commencement speakers should be fairly uncontroversial; save the controversy for other campus venues. In that sense you are mistaken in linking this to the ""coddled mind"" stuff. This isn't about coddling students; I'd have no problem with Holland giving a talk on any campus if there's a group there that wants to host him. But commencement is different! This is not hard to understand, I think.

&#x200B;

2: In all this discussion of free speech and hearing opposing views, there's an important distinction between someone like Ann Coulter and someone like Jeff Holland. I find Coulter repugnant, but she is making an actual argument that can be debated. If she points to harms caused by immigration, students can be pointed to data on the good things immigrants bring to a country. Holland and other Church leaders don't make arguments that are up for debate in that manner. Holland's argument is ""I represent God, and he told me gay people shouldn't have rights."" That's not the kind of argument that provides any kind of value in a free speech environment. What insight is gained by people going around claiming to speak for God? What is the counter argument to that? What great insight or perspective are students gaining? Should David Koresh be invited to speak at university commencements? After all, his argument is basically the same as Holland's, that is, ""I speak for God so what I say is correct irrespective of evidence or logic you might have."" Holland is coming out of a tradition that says that scholarly debate, evidence, and logic are not the path to understanding; rather, the correct path is to listen to, and obey, the guys who are going around claiming to speak for God. Again, if someone on a college campus wants to host that kind of thing--whether it be Holland or Koresh or Ayatollah Khomeini or whomever--that's fine. But let's not pretend this kind of speaker adds meaningful perspective to an academic setting.

I was once challenged on reddit exmormon about a post I made relating to a story on Fox News about the church.   A redditor ""accosted"" me and said: What are you doing listening to Fox News?

 I swear that has chapped my hide for years.  I listen to as many angles as possible, and I don't appreciate being told how to inform myself.  I know how to change the channel and I do frequently.

That aside, I thought the Coulter violence was wrong. Peaceful demonstrations: AOK.

As for Holland I think one problem is there is a difference between a speech and a sermon. 

 I'm sure Holland could come up with a talk that had testable information as a foundation (as in research and logic) but whether he WILL do that is questionable.  I've never heard him do it before, so why an institution of higher learning should seek out his voice is a mystery.

I also have a problem with a graduation speaker representing an organization that allows for leadership opportunities for only 50 percent of a graduating class.  Why would that be inspiring to women?  He can try with his words to inspire, but actions speak louder.

Holland was a terrible tone-deaf choice, but at least what he says will be interesting to those of us who appreciate logic and research.  Let's see if he can give a speech instead of a sermon, for once.  His failure or success could be instructive.

If that is the goal, then perhaps SUU could invite several commencement speakers in advance, like:

2023: Holland

2024: Richard Dawkins

2025: Mike Lee

2026: Elliott Page

I only say this in jest, because I don't think commencement ceremonies should be anything about diversity of perspectives. The commencement speaker should be fairly neutral, because the goal of commencement is to celebrate the achievements of the graduates, not to honor or promote or give platform to some unique viewpoint. Do that some other day of the year. Do that lots of times throughout the year!

While at UVU in 2008 or 2009 I believe, Elder Uchtdorf came and gave a speech. It was fine. A few faculty were bothered by it because he was coming to give a non-religious speech, but his credentials in a secular setting (like most LDS leaders) was pretty limited. They felt like he should have been speaking in the Institute building, not the basketball arena.

I've had a hard time putting my thoughts about this mess on the subreddit into words, and you said it better than I could have.

To add to your point, I believe in listening to every side, and opportunities ought to be given to a diverse range of speakers to speak, especially in universities. I would hope that we in America, and specifically those of us former Mormons who have learned the priceless value of free (and critical) expression, will uphold the spirit of free speech as much as the letter of the law.

That said, even though I wouldn't sign the petition that's been going around in favor of suppressing a voice I disagree with, there is a legitimate criticism against SUU's choice of Holland as a speaker which has been glossed over in this sub in favor of the LGBTQ+ problems, which is that there is really no reason to have Holland speak at all. Outside of Universities in Utah, his resume would be laughable, and his opinions completely irrelevant. He may be the best public speaker of the 15 (which is not saying much), but that doesn't mean he has anything valuable to say to anyone outside his own echo chamber. That begs the question, why was he asked to speak at all? Certainly not for the benefit of the students.

So yes, we who disagree should make our voices heard. And then we should listen to Holland, just like we wish he'd listen to his critics. But in my opinion the critique that Holland is irrelevant to students at SUU is more important than that he is offensive to certain students.",Ender367,2023-03-23,Ireland

(Thanks to Brenna for this bit, because I didn't write this right the first time.) 

I disagree somewhat strongly with this. Research shows that district based representation in cities leads to more NIMBYism, because those representatives feel more beholden to the few loud voices in their area, rather than to the city as a whole and what's best for everyone, including future inhabitants.

I do think there are perhaps improvements that could be made in the current system. As a progressive, I am happy to have Kebler, Perkins, Schenkelberg (who I am really sorry to see go) and Broadman on council. They each bring some good perspectives with them that I appreciate. However, each of them won their races in about a 60/40 split, if I recall correctly. It would be fairer if that 40% did have a voice on council, if obviously not a majority. 

I'm not exactly sure how best to accomplish that and I'm much more worried about institutions like the US Senate, which is extremely unrepresentative, but ... fair's fair.",davidw,2022-05-19,Ireland

Some Orthodox believe that there can’t be another ecumenical council until (at least) the Great Schism is healed. Others accept the post-Schism councils as fully ecumenical. Also, bear in mind that the Orthodox conception of infallibility is somewhat different from the Catholic one, to the extent that they tend to avoid using the word (although it’s not completely absent). 

That’s not a direct answer to your question; just some additional context.

Edit: To be clear, there have definitely been Orthodox councils since the Schism; that’s not in dispute. The question is whether they were properly “ecumenical” in the way that the first seven were. The most recent was the Council of Crete in 2016. It was convened by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, but a number of churches didn’t attend, for a variety of reasons (Antioch, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Russia didn’t attend; the Orthodox Church in America wasn’t invited).",mrchristmastime,2022-09-24,Ireland

All of the first 7 Councils were called by the emperor.  So from a historical perspective everyone must agree that we don’t need the Pope of Rome or Patriarch of Constantinople or any particular bishop to call a Council.

This objection is a straw-man though.  Local and regional Councils when accepted by all function just like the historical Ecumenical Councils in Orthodoxy.

Which Father said the Ecumenical Councils alone are infallible?

I asked my priest about this recently.  This is what he said:

*”Anytime truth is spoken and authentic love exists Christ is in our midst!   Sometimes it happens on a local, regional, or larger Church level, e.g. 7 times in the [Ecumenical Council] case.  Sometimes the faith explained by a local or regional council, or stated or written by a saint brings such clarity it is considered part of the mind of Christ, e.g. St Gregory Palamas.”*

Our ecclesiology isn’t broken because Christ is in our midst!  “ *Where two or more are gathered…* “

We don’t understand the Councils from a position of legal ratification or the like.  

Not debating.  Just offering clarification.  Hope that helps :-)

The head makes sure procedures are followed, but does not influence the committee review nor sits in on the meeting in any way), and the University Review Committee doesn't really happen (I don't think) unless there are 'issues'.

We start with department (all tenured faculty in the unit, except the head, and chaired by someone appointed by the head to chair the committee usually on three year terms). The 'departmental committee' does a letter and recommendation to the next step. Split votes are common, in which case majority and minority opinions get written.

Then the head does their own assessment, agrees/disagrees with department majority opinion, sends it forward.

Then college wide committee reviews all that and recommends. I suppose they could do split votes, but this committee is small enough that they usually have consensus.

Then the Dean reviews all that and recommends on up.

Then the provost reviews and recommends on up.

Then the board of regents make the provost recommendation official (though, I guess they *could* nix something on their own, that is worrisome).

And, the faculty gets a copy of each letter on each step, and has so many days to submit a statement that gets sent up the chain. So, like, if the Head writes a negative recommendation, you can write a letter that is reviewed by the next step up (college wide).

Which sucks about the process is there is so much tension about what can and can't be communicated. The committees are tight lipped. Only the letter can speak forward. The head and dean can't talk to the faculty member about any part of the process once it started except for the official letters.  It creates an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion.

And I've seen enough cases that get derailed at any step (anywhere on up to the dean's level. I've not yet seen a provost or the board flip the recommendation of the dean or provost, respectively).",EngProfOkstate,2023-03-31,Ireland

It was started by John the baptizer. One of his disciples was Jesus of Nazareth, who became a prominent person in the movement. When John died, Jesus took over most of the movement.

This is a rather fantastical view of the narrative in the Gospels, with little to no connection to what is said therein. John's consistent position throughout the Gospels narratives, and *entirely without exception* is the superiority of Jesus to himself. 

cf 

John 1:23 John said, “**I am the voice of one shouting in the wilderness**, ‘Make straight the way **for the Lord**’

John 3:27 John replied, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven. **28 You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but rather, ‘I have been sent before him.’** 29 The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. **The friend of the bridegroom, who stands by and listens for him, rejoices greatly when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. This then is my joy, and it is complete**. 30 **He must become more important while I become less important**.”

So your assertion about Jesus being a disciple of John is false. Your assertion about Jesus rising to prominence after John's death is false.

>Contrary to the Epistle of James, Paul preaches justification by faith rather than works of the law (Galatians 2:16, Romans 3:28)

You neither understand Paul's point nor James'. 

James is saying that true faith cannot exist absent of change in behavior and action.

Paul's point is that soteriology *depends not* on our action, but in believing loyalty to God through the Messiah. This standard is *in no way* novel. Paul goes into excruciating detail on the consistency of this with the narrative of the Tanakh.

Paul then **goes on make the same point as James** in Romans 6! 

* 6:1 What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase? 2 Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? 

* 12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires, 13 and do not present your members to sin as instruments to be used for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead and your members to God as instruments to be used for righteousness.

* 15 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? **Absolutely not!** 16 Do you not know that if you present yourselves as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or obedience resulting in righteousness?

*  17 But thanks be to God that though you were slaves to sin, **you obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching you were entrusted to, 18 and having been freed from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness**.

One has to remember the purpose of the law plus old vs new covenants.",Deep_Chicken2965,2023-03-30,Ireland

Teaching Council AND Requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/126k6y3/paul_does_not_represent_the_views_of_jesus/,Paul does not represent the views of Jesus,"This kind of reasoning (i.e., ""Jesus' religion was different from Paul's"") was long ago rebutted in detail by J. Gresham Machen's ""The Origin of Paul's Religion"" (1921).  There's nothing new in these kinds of arguments; they have endlessly been rebutted by conservative Christian scholars.  I would suggest by quoting from Machen's century-old book and then rebutting them, if one is to be at all persuasive to an informed opposition.

A key prop of such arguments is to argue that Paul's view of the law was difference from Jesus', which I would deny as a Christian who keeps the seventh-day Sabbath, observes the holy days listed in Leviticus 23, pays tithes, and avoids eating unclean meat.  

Paul made many pro-law statements (Rom. 3:31; 7:12, 22; 8:7; 13:9), and quoted from the Old Testament law as an authority.  Paul sees the law as a guide to identifying correct conduct, such as in Rom. 7:7 (Williams translation):  ""What are we then to conclude?  Is the law sin?  Of course not!  Yet, if it had not been for the law, I should not have learned what sin was, for I should not have known what an evil desire was, if the law had not said, 'You must not have an evil desire.'”  But for Paul neither the law nor obedience to it was the source of justification (setting aside the issues raised by Rom. 2:13), which was the main point of his letter to the Galatians.  In order to reconcile some of Paul's seemingly contradictory statements on the law, it's necessary also to remember the distinction between the moral law, such as found in the Ten Commandments, which is still in force, and ritualistic/ceremonial laws, such as circumcision and the animal sacrifices, which are no longer in force (I Cor. 7:19).  

The Apostle Paul surely taught that inward saving faith must manifest outward good works, or else it's bogus (Rom. 2:13):  “For not the hearers of the Law are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.”  Paul clearly proclaimed that Christians in a state of grace should avoid a life of sin (Rom. 6:1-2, 15):  “What shall we say then?  Are we to continue to sin that grace might increase?  May it never be!  How shall we who died to sin still live in it? . . .  What then?  Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace?  May it never be!”  

Sure, it has been  commonly argued that the Jerusalem conference in Acts 15 abolished not just circumcision for gentiles, but the entire Old Testament law.  Advocates of this position will cite Acts 15:5, which mentions what some of the Pharisees who became Christians said concerning having the gentiles circumcised:  “It is necessary to circumcise them, and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses.”  Hence, when the Council decided to set aside circumcision, it’s said that it also set aside the entire Old Testament law code.  The Greek of v. 5, however, indicates this interpretation is unwarranted:  It’s a periphrastic construction, or an intentional roundabout way to say something, which the “and” between the second and third verbs (“direct” and “observe”) strongly suggests.  But even if the linguistic issues are discounted, does anyone plausibly think that the conference in Acts 15 not only abolished the four laws that the antinomians oppose (the Sabbath, the Holy Days, tithing, and clean/unclean meat), but the laws against murder, adultery, coveting, idolatry, or theft?   Were the two Great Commandments, which Jesus quoted with approval, trashed as well?  Once again, the antinomians overshoot their mark, since their argument disposes of much too much.  Furthermore, if the entire Law of Moses was obliterated, why are these four laws from the Old Testament singled out as being in force?:  “It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials:  that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well” (Acts 15:28-29).  If Jesus’ death annihilated the entire “Law of Moses” or the entire “Old Covenant,” then why are these four laws retained?  The mere fact that they still exist proves that the Old Testament law wasn’t completely abolished!  Furthermore, when the apostle James announces the final decision of the Council, if he meant to nullify the authority of Moses, why does he say (Acts 15:21):  “For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath”?  Why cite Moses as an authority when you’ve just destroyed his authority?  

All the absurdities flowing from the antinomian interpretation of Acts 15 proves alternatives should be considered.  The conference in Acts 15 was really about what could be called “justification,” or the initial stage of the salvation process.  After all, what set off the entire debate was this assertion:  “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved” (v. 1).  The real dispute was over what gives salvation, not so much over what laws still have to be obeyed intrinsically.  It’s especially important now to realize that the Jews considered circumcision as an initiation rite analogous to what Christians consider baptism’s role in Christianity:  You can’t be a (male) Jew without being circumcised.  This worked fine for those born Jews, but what about adult male converts to Judaism?  (Another problem cropped up concerning those ex-pagans who were circumcised for “the wrong reasons”!)  Previously, before the Acts 15 Council occurred, in Judaism historically near and before the time of Jesus’ death and resurrection, a running debate had festered between different rabbinical schools over which Old Testament laws needed to be imposed on gentile converts of Judaism.  These four laws (listed in vs. 28-29) weren’t randomly plucked from thin air, but were the same ones that the standard alternative non-Pharisaical interpretation of what the law imposed on gentile converts so they could become full members of the covenant community of Israel.  The Pharisees (or at least one of their major schools) believed circumcision had to be added to this list of four requirements (which originates in Lev. 17-18), but their opponents in Judaism felt otherwise.  Actually, all the church did in Acts 15 was to choose the competing interpretation among Jews that denied that gentiles had to be circumcised in order to become converts to the faith.  So when Peter calls some aspect of the law a “yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear,” it shouldn’t be assumed that this was the entire law of Moses.  Again, it’s necessary to note that just because obeying any given law doesn’t justify us, whether it be the law against murder, the law about helping the poor, or the law about tithing, that doesn’t prove no sin is assessed when we violate it or that we don’t still have to obey it.  Since the issue in debate concerned circumcision and the initial stage of the salvation process as Judaism had considered it, it’s wrong to assume that the Acts 15 Council abolished the entire Old Testament law.",snoweric,2023-03-31,Ireland

I'm not sure if this will affect your argument itself, but this is a theological input into an otherwise historical argument, which seems to rely on theological interpretations, and I wanted to help you with that, from the gentile orthodox Christian side. I think it's better to use this, when comparing the Jewish Christian teachings. 

The focal point of the canonical gospel's teachings, Paul's epistles and orthodox Christians, is that God is love, Christ is Lord and that Christianity's ulimate goal is theosis/deification. In the gospels, in Paul's epistles and in orthodox theology, love is the most desired virtue and the substance without which anything is useless and hollow. Even miracle working is useless, if not for love (1 Corrinthians 13:2). Furthermore, the attainment of the image of God is the central commandment of both the gospels and the epistles of Paul, e.g. “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly father is 
perfect,” Mt. 5:48,l “Instead, as he
who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct,” 1 Pet. 1:15). All the tirades about sexual immorality and poverty stem from this and are built around it.   

Perfection is the point of orthodox Christianity and canon, perfection in the way of deification, theosis. The works v faith, and poor v rich, seem to be anahronistic and largely a jab at Luther, not Paul.",rulnav,2023-04-03,Ireland

Most other states don't; some used to but no longer do. Do you think this should be a requirement? Why or why not?","The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.

**Summary:**

It seems more common for states to incentivize rather than require Master's degrees for teachers to advance their certification. However, such requirements still do exist.

It was surprisingly hard for me to find out exactly which states still have them. Maybe I am just having a bad case of the Mondays.

Anyway, it looks like this is a requirement in at least CT and NY:

https://www.nysut.org/resources/special-resources-sites/look-at-teaching/becoming-a-teacher-legacy

https://www.highered.nysed.gov/tcert/certificate/relatedmasters.html

https://business.ct.gov/-/media/SDE/Certification/Alerts/certalert_nov2017.pdf

This is fewer states than I remember back when my wife was a classroom teacher; some that used to have it no longer do. This article talks about Kentucky removing its requirement a few years ago and quotes some people who were for and against that change:

https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/teachers-in-kentucky-no-longer-have-to-earn-a-masters-degree/2018/08

>Kentucky officials have removed a requirement that teachers obtain master’s degrees, sparking mixed reaction from the field. 

>The state Education Professional Standards Board voted on Monday to remove the requirement that Kentucky teachers earn a master’s degree by their 10th year in the profession. Now, there are only three states that require teachers to earn a master’s degree (or its equivalent) for license advancement, according to the National Council on Teacher Quality—Connecticut, Maryland, and New York.

[I'm not totally sure if it's still absolutely required in Maryland in 2022.]

...

>While some research has shown that having an advanced degree in the subject taught (mainly math and science) makes middle and high school teachers more effective, other studies have found that for the most part, teachers with master’s degrees are no more effective than those without. In an interview with the Kentucky Chamber Bottom Line, Lewis said the state should be focused more on educational outcomes “rather than the intense focus we’ve had in the past on teachers earning credential after credential and adding things to their resume.”

>Still, Democratic state House leaders have asked the standards board to reconsider its decision, calling it a “backward step” that “expects less professionally from our educators,” according to the Lexington Herald-Leader.

>Richard Day, a professor in the college of education at Eastern Kentucky University, put it this way: “This is the first major retreat from high standards that I can recall over my 46-year career,” he told the paper.

>However, Gary Houchens, a Kentucky Board of Education member, wrote on his personal blog that getting rid of a “one-size-fits-all state mandate” will have a positive effect on teachers and their professional development.

>""[T]his policy change simply gives teachers the opportunity to decide whether a master’s degree is the right pathway for them individually,” he wrote. “Most will do so, and will continue to be compensated accordingly. ... [T]hese kind of changes ultimately create more autonomy for individual educators and local schools to innovate and improve.” 

**Questions:**

* Should public school teachers be required to obtain a Master's degree to continue and advance their certification?

* If yes, why? If no, why not?

* If yes, should this be extended to private school teachers as well?

* If no, should graduate coursework and advanced degrees be incentivized even if not required?

In an earlier thread, I argued that they shouldn't be required to have a masters of education to teach, if they have some equivalent experience in it, so I'd probably not be in favor of a masters in your field for non-college education. Having real-world experience is more useful than degrees and such anyway (lots of aloof superintendents in my district, trying to propose stuff based on what they read in a thesis somewhere rather than what actually works. It took them actually having to teach again due to temporary outages to actually start considering how their policies Manifest in the classroom)

I think if there's a large enough pool of otherwise qualified teachers to pick from, it's not a bad idea to prioritize those with Master's Degrees or other secondary educations. If states or Municipalities or Districts want to make that a *requirement*, then I say go for it, so long they're still able to hire enough teachers to adequately staff their schools.

I don't think that's the case for most places in the US however. Hell, a lot of places seem to have trouble finding enough qualified applicants with even undergrad degrees. Should we pay teachers more in order to spur more applicants? Sure, but that isn't what you're asking here.

This is not the only reason that I felt discouraged from pursuing teaching, to be honest.  But it was a major factor in my decision. 


Furthermore, many teachers I have talked to (including my mom) have told me that most of the education classes they took were worthless.   (Exceptions:   student teaching, and maybe 1-2 curriculum classes).

While purely anecdotal, my Master's Degree did not help me very much at all. It was very theory based and impractical. Granted, I am sure there are better Master's programs out there than mine, but I'd say only 5% of what I learned was actually useful (unless I wanted to get into a research field).

What did help me was doing a 1-month teaching certification. All it entailed was teaching students, getting feedback from tutors and peers, and making a revised lesson plan with those changes. Essentially it was just on the job training. I had almost no experience when I began, and now, nearly 20 years and many impractical workshops later, it's still the only really meaningful training I've ever had.

>That the Jews are participants in God’s salvation is theologically unquestionable, but how that can be possible without confessing Christ explicitly, is and remains an unfathomable divine mystery (from a Vatican document, entitled *The Gifts and the Calling of God are Irrevocable*)

When the two theories you refer to are taken too absolutely, they're both half wrong and half right, as each one rejects one of the two prongs of the ""that"" clause that is affirmed as a ""unfathomable divine mystery"" in that document. It is true that the Church's teaching at times has emphasized more one or other of those two prongs. 

There are at least two factors leading us to concentrate more on the first prong (""the Jews are participants in God’s salvation"") than perhaps we have in the past. Firstly, we have the benefit of the conciliar teaching in *Nostra Aetate*, which previous generations did not. Secondly (and, to some extent, underlying the first), the horror of the Holocaust led the Church to exercise a strenuous scrutiny over all previous teachings that referred to contemporary Jews.

Edgley, a member of the Presiding Bishopric (1992-2012), gives a talk on honesty and integrity at the 2006 General Conference just months after he, in unison with the First Presidency and Presiding Bishopric, approved the formation of a second shell LLC in Delaware (in name only).","Thanks. This is very enlightening. I think you say it well. Trust has been lost. I see no reason to trust what church leadership say and a lot of reason to not believe it. However, church leadership has been lying to the membership of the church since the beginning, and promoting two different standards of behavior, one for leadership and one for members. In 1831 we got Section 42 which says to be faithful to your wife and in the same year, according to the church's own claims we also had the ""revelation"" to take wives of the Lamanites. I did not fully appreciate the existence of two different standards until I had time to read more.  

From this time, the level of deception only increased till the Nauvoo period when it was like living in some sort of fantasy land. My wife thinks that if they will lie about one thing, then they will lie about another. It seems to me that she is right and that there is a pattern of lying among church leadership. However, it was indeed a good talk, much better than most I was hearing before I quit bothering to listen to these men. I was reminded of this talk from your post.

Good news is a lot of your questions can be answered with ""The rules and system accounts for that already.

Bad news is the rest are answered with ""That's not how this game works.""

1) The system already accounts for this. The cost of multi-speccing adds up fast. So any player taking more than 2-3 total specs is going to find they are behind the curve pretty fast. So no worries there outside of some system cheering.

2) Not how the game works. Ranks and positions,  Jedi or otherwise, are narrative options and often Parton the character concept  from the kick off. Lashing XP requirements to it may feel right in theory. In practice though,  it sucks more than is cool. If someone wants to play a Jedi knight, then they should be able to within the bounds of the specific campaign you are running. But don't lock it behind a pay wall, or MMO style level grind that's more about maintaining your subscription than actually being fun.
Uyimg
3) The system mostly accounts for this. Special items can be awarded, but largely are just bought. And getting really serious, they are modded. So like only a few Saber crystals are amazing out of the box, but the majority need to be modded by the player to be really cool.
4) System mostly  accounts for this. There some fine details, but ,mixing forcees and nonforcees works fine.

What a chapter! What a debate. The perils of overpolicing and underpolicing is at the heart of it. A perfect balance is impossible. So do we throw potentially innocent people into prison rather than risk the guilty walking free? Or do we let the guilty walk free to avoid any chance of the innocent being punished unfairly.

As with all big problems, there is no right or concrete answer, especially as any solution at all will have humans with human error and human corruption running it. Look at the Shawshank Redemption for a good example. 

It's a hard topic, but it makes for great debates. 

As does fatherhood and the trials therein.

Sure, you can speculate about the theoretical possibility of hell, but speculating about the damnation of a specific person means you are essentially condemning them (and by extension of Romans 2 you are condemning yourself).

(**SIDEBAR:** Consider that Littlefinger's man Ser Morgarth is the Elder Brother of Quiet Isle. Meanwhile, for some reason GRRM wanted the High Sparrow — a ""small spare man""; ""shorter than the queen by several inches and as thin as a broom handle""; with a ""sharply pointed"" face, a ""sharp face and a short beard, grizzled grey and brown""; ""sharp-featured"", with ""hard eyes"" — to bear a passing similarity to Littlefinger, who has ""sharp features"", whose eyes don't smile when his mouth does, who is ""small"", ""short"", ""slight"", ""slender"", with a ""pointed chin beard"" and ""threads of silver in his dark hair"". Does Littlefinger have an elder brother, in addition to 'his' Elder Brother? **END**)

The overthrow of Harmund and the mutilation of his Lannister mother by the Shrike and Hagon leads to a war between the ironborn and the Lannisters. The results sound like the results of 'Petyr's' war in the Riverlands:
>The war between the ironborn and the westermen continued in a desultory fashion for five more years, finally ending in an exhausted peace that left the Iron Islands impoverished, burned, and broken. The winter that followed was long and harsh, and is remembered on the isles as the Famine Winter. Hake tells us that three times as many ironmen perished of starvation that winter than had died in the battles that preceded it.

A famine in winter? Why, that's just what Petyr's gearing up to profit from with the grain-stockpiling scheme he's launched in the Vale c. *TWOW Alayne I*:
>[Petyr:] ""Post guardsmen on the docks. If need be, seize the ships. How does not matter, so long as no food leaves the Vale.""

>""These prices, though,"" protested fat Lord Belmore,"" these prices are more than fair.""

>""You say more than fair, my lord. I say less than we would wish. Wait. If need be, buy the food yourself and keep it stored. Winter is coming. Prices must go higher.""

Thus the Shrike's sept-burning, lie-decrying, famine-inducing rebellion seems to rework events of *ASOIAF*, including the burning of Riverland septs, traceable to Petyr's Big Little Lie. But that's not the only thing I think it's doing. (""All things come round again"", again.)


###The Shrike's Rebellion & King's Landing in *ACOK*
I submit that the Shrike-fueled grassroots rebellion and the burning of the septs is *also* a kaleidoscopic reworking of motifs found around Petyr's machinations to destabilize King's Landing by inflaming its population c. *ACOK*. Consider that Petyr's first move is to impose an ironbornishly ""clever and cruel"" tax on refugees:
>""Lord Littlefinger… has imposed a tax on those wishing to enter the city.""

>""Yes, that would work,"" Tyrion said, thinking, Clever. Clever and cruel. Tens of thousands had fled the fighting for the supposed safety of King's Landing. He had seen them on the kingsroad, troupes of mothers and children and anxious fathers who had gazed on his horses and wagons with covetous eyes. Once they reached the city they would doubtless pay over all they had to put those high comforting walls between them and the war… *(ACOK Tyrion I)*

Petyr's tax on poor and desperate refugees is both (a) de facto legalized piracy, leveraging their fear of violence to extract coin they can't afford to give up, and (b) a surely unpopular ""edict"". Thus it neatly prefigures Handsome Harmund issuing an unpopular edict that outlawed the legalized piracy of reaving, leading to the Shrike and ""other priests"" of his kind overthrowing him and installing Hagon, who quickly restored the familiar regime of legalized piracy.

Note that the Shrike et al. ""blamed"" Harmund's ""Lannister mother"" — ""the Lannister 'whore',"" they called her — both for ""influenc[ing]"" his ""edicts"" and ""for turning her husband and sons away from the true god"" and toward ""demon-worship"". And recall that the shrike cut out Harmund's tongue, then cut off his nose ""so 'all men might see him for the monster he is.'""

'Naturally' *all* those motifs prove immanent in subsequent events in King's Landing, and hence recursive, as GRRM's fake histories almost *entirely* are, by design. To wit…

####The Neo-Shrikes
The groundwork of discontent having been laid by Petyr's onerous entry tax, Shrike-esque street preachers blossom in King's Landing.
>[Varys:] We also have a sudden plague of holy men. The comet has brought forth all manner of queer priests, preachers, and prophets, it would seem. They… foretell doom and destruction to anyone who stops to listen."" … ""They are spreading fear, my lord."" *(ACOK Tyrion II)*

The ""sudden plague"" of inflammatory street preachers is, of course, very possibly the doing of Littlefinger, or at least surreptitiously supported by him. Indeed, when we get a long look at such a ""preacher"", he mentions the Littlefinger-spawned rumor that Selyse fucked Patchface, suggesting he's a tool of Littlefinger (whether he knows it or not).

More pertinently to the main point here, the preacher also casts blame at both the Lannisters and the Faith, *exactly as the Shrike and his ilk did:*
>[A] sizable crowd had gathered beneath the leather awnings to listen to the rantings of a prophet. A robe of undyed wool belted with a hempen rope marked him for one of the begging brothers.

>**""Corruption!""** the man **cried shrilly [like a shrink!]**. ""There is the warning! Behold the Father's scourge!"" He pointed at the fuzzy red wound in the sky. From this vantage, the distant castle on Aegon's High Hill was directly behind him, with the comet hanging forebodingly over its towers. A clever choice of stage, Tyrion reflected. ""We have become swollen, bloated, foul. **Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon. Highborn ladies fornicate with fools and give birth to monsters! Even the High Septon has forgotten the gods!** He bathes in scented waters and grows fat on lark and lamprey while his people starve! Pride comes before prayer, maggots rule our castles, and gold is all . . . but no more! The Rotten Summer is at an end, and the **Whoremonger** King is brought low! When the boar did open him, a great stench rose to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly, hissing and biting!"" He jabbed his bony finger back at comet and castle. ""There comes the Harbinger! Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine of righteousness, or **you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!**""

>**""Fire!"" other voices echoed**, but the hoots of derision almost drowned them out. Tyrion took solace from that. He gave the command to continue, and the litter rocked **like a ship on a rough sea [see: the ironborn]** as the Burned Men cleared a path. Twisted little monkey demon indeed. The wretch did have a point about the High Septon, to be sure. What was it that Moon Boy had said of him the other day? A pious man who worships the Seven so fervently that he eats a meal for each of them whenever he sits to table. The memory of the fool's jape made Tyrion smile. *(ACOK Tyrion V)*

Summing up, the prophet attacks not just Joffrey's own ""Lannister mother"" a la the Shrike but his Lannister uncle Tyrion, a soon-to-noseless (like Handsome Harmund) ""monkey demon"" who he blames for playing the ""pipes"" to which Joffrey ""capers"", much as Harmund's mother was ""blamed"" for ""influenc[ing]"" him, ""for turning [him] away from the true god"" to ""demon-worship"". He also castigates the High Septon for his degeneracy and calls for a cleansing ""fire"", prefiguring the Shrike denouncing the septons, bringing about their expulsion, and instigating the burning of the septs.

Note that the preacher ironically gestures towards the guy the people *should* be pissed at when he decries ""Corruption!"" and ""the Whoremonger King"": the *actual* king of whoremongers, Littlefinger, who is almost certainly helming a massive empire of graft built on ""corruption"", bilking the crown dry, and levying nasty taxes on desperate and poor people. But Petyr isn't mentioned, as the prophet seems ""only"" to be priming the population to hate the High Septon (who likely knows ""too much"" about Petyr's chicanery and who irritated Petyr during recent negotiations per *AGOT Eddard IV*) and the Lannisters — especially Petyr's nemesis Tyrion — just as the Shrike and his kind stoked the Iron Islanders against Handsome Harmund.

####The Streets Blame The Lannisters
And indeed, this focus on the Lannisters and specifically on Tyrion seems to penetrate the populace of King's Landing, given the assessment of ""the city"" delivered by Jacelyn Bywater (called ""Ironhand"", a la Hardhand Hoare!) later in *ACOK,* which puts it on the precipice of a *very* Shrike-esque rebellion:
>""We held the city today, my lord, but I make no promises for the morrow. The kettle is close to boiling. … There's open talk of treason…."" … ""There is small love for the Lannisters in King's Landing. Many still remember how your lord father sacked the city, when Aerys opened the gates to him. **They whisper that the gods are punishing us for the sins of your House**—for your brother's murder of King Aerys, for the butchery of Rhaegar's children, for the execution of Eddard Stark and the savagery of Joffrey's justice. Some talk openly of how much better things were when Robert was king, and hint that times would be better again with Stannis on the throne.…""

On the other hand, if a masters is necessary to do the job then rather than require teachers to do it eventually they should make that an entry level requirement of the job.

I am a teacher.

While purely anecdotal, my Master's Degree did not help me very much at all. It was very theory based and impractical. Granted, I am sure there are better Master's programs out there than mine, but I'd say only 5% of what I learned was actually useful (unless I wanted to get into a research field).

What did help me was doing a 1-month teaching certification. All it entailed was teaching students, getting feedback from tutors and peers, and making a revised lesson plan with those changes. Essentially it was just on the job training. I had almost no experience when I began, and now, nearly 20 years and many impractical workshops later, it's still the only really meaningful training I've ever had. So honestly, I think anyone could be a decent teacher with a similar system. There are many paths to educational licenses and degrees that don't have a single minute of teaching practice, which I think should be addressed before Master's Degrees.",BricksFriend,2022-08-30,Ireland

The Church has propped up leaders as infallible despite whatever we may say.  It sets up the leader and the layperson for an eventual fall and disappointment.  I guess I am blessed that I do not put any person on a pedestal.  Nor do I condemn someone for something that I disagree with.  In my heart, I've always been weary of throwing my loyalty blindly to anyone.  I follow the facts and listen to God's whisperings.  Too many TBMs have forfeited their agency for critical thinking and fallen to Mosaic period of discipleship.  ""Moses said it; so do it.""  Learning history is about not repeating the mistakes of the past.  The Lord wants us to know as part of our path to perfection.  Our doctrine is perfect in terms of completion but our Church is not.  You stamp out racism but remembering the misdeeds of others.  But those misdeeds do not outright discredit the good they have done.

Teaching Council AND Requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/JumpChain/comments/ttno2u/matters_of_teaching/,Matters of Teaching,"My take:

""Elements of Tradition"" is your best bet for teaching super-fast teaching.  It's both a skill uncapper and a teaching uncapper, allowing you to pass on skills exceeding normal caps, so if you practice teaching with it for long enough to develop super-fast teaching with this perk, then the same perk will allow you' to teach others to super-fast teaching.  But it's a relatively slow skill uncapper.  It may allow some viral spread of your students teaching students who teach students who surpass normal limitations, but I wouldn't guarantee that.  And proper use of this for teaching requires that you have spent a very long time teaching first, which your jumper might not have despite his age.  

""Eastern Sage"" is your best bet if you're trying to teach things that are impossible under local metaphysics but were possible in some setting that you jumped earlier.  It can include the ability to spread virally too - teaching people to teach magic, including the teaching of magic teachers, in a setting where magic should be impossible, for instance.  Unfortunately it probably doesn't include teaching super-fast teaching unless you've visited a setting that somehow allowed super-fast teaching - which some do, via psionics or advanced technology or something, and you could teach the psionics or tech involved, but that might not be what you want.  It does not actually impart your fiat-backed benefits, just skills and abilities that were more or less conventional in some other jump.  

""The Teacher of Ages"" lets you teach things normally too complex to fit in your students brains, but no viral effect, no metaphysics breaking, and it's not really that big a benefit for teaching super-fast teaching.  

The others aren't great for your purposes - they make your efforts easier / faster / more fruitful, but they won't let you do anything you couldn't have done otherwise.",naarn,2022-04-01,Ireland

Yet, Churches of Christ do plenty of it. They have added to church organization, assembly actions, altered the Lord's Supper, added ""required"" assemblies God did not command, and they countenance, and even encourage, the incorporation of false religion into the lives of members.  They have made a habit of making laws where God did not.  They are divided along so many lines that it is foolish to think that just having the cherished name actually means anything.  

Foy E. Wallace, Jr., “Bulwarks of the Faith,” Vol. I, page 38, said, “The wrong creed, the wrong doctrine, the wrong worship, the wrong organization, and the wrong name could not possibly result in the right church.  But the right creed, the right doctrine, the right worship, the right organization, and the right name, for a like reason, cannot be the wrong church.”

It is easily proved that Churches of Christ have wrong doctrine, wrong organization, and wrong worship. Sadly, they don't know it, nor do they even reflect on it, save for very few of them.",jimmythegreek1986,2023-03-17,Ireland

Elections are a year away, just use your media outlets during the next year to swing voters towards your own party and when the election campaign season begins, then you can start pouring out everything at him to get people to vote for your party. Everyone's tired of constantly elections, changing leaders, political news, why create more instability? 

Sure QP has a right to be pissed for Hayk not sticking with the party and backing them up, anyone would be, but that's also the fault of their own short-sightedness. As for Hayk working alone, then that's not just because of him that's also because the political parties in charge don't want to negotiate and come to compromises on policies. Every side wants to have it fully their way and that's not how this should work. Work on issues that you can come to an understanding with him and make those changes then once your candidate wins the next elections you can work on to implement the stuff you couldn't with Hayk. 

Hayks ambitions when he became a mayor weren't ideological ones backed by any party, he was never striving to create an environment where political figures were to have ideologies loyal to a party and QP should have seen this from a mile away. It has always been obvious. He was protesting against the bus fare hikes back in 2013 against the then Yerevan government, then again he protests against the government during electric Yerevan in 2015. 

His goal was just to create better living conditions for the residents and from the looks of it he has. As for the elevator talk, it shouldn't be the governments responsibility to replace elevators in buildings. It should be the responsibility of the residents living in that building to come together, create a management system, collect funds and make the necessary repairs the building needs for everyone's benefit and safety. The roofs leaking? Have a management that deals with it. Want solar panels on building roofs? Propose it to the management and see if it can be funded. Elevator is old? Have a management that repairs it instead of waiting for the government to come and do it. So many of the newly installed elevators are being treated like dumpsters because the residents didn't see the money directly come out of their pockets to pay for them so they're taking them for granted. 

Just like how farmers are being pushed to unionize, residents of buildings should be pushed to become represetable under a larger stronger entity too, this way Karo won't be able to extend his 5th story balcon 20 meters forward, and when it snows, Anahit tatik won't be afraid of slipping on ice because there will be someone there to shovel the snow instead of everyone waiting for their neighbor to do it.",T0ManyTakenUsernames,2021-12-17,Ireland

China orders nationwide inspections of kindergartens following child abuse claims

2017/11/24

The State Council called for nationwide inspections of kindergartens Friday following allegations of child abuse at a Beijing private kindergarten that sparked public outrage Thursday.

Kindergartens in several cities have reportedly been engaged in child abuse. Such incidents show that some kindergartens have failed to implement measures and were poorly managed, according to a notice issued by the education committee of the State Council Friday.

Beijing has launched a citywide inspection of kindergartens, and local education commission is also requiring kindergartens in all districts to improve safety, professional ethics and teaching quality, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission said on its Weibo Friday.

The authority's move comes after preschool children at the RYB Education New World kindergarten in Chaoyang district were allegedly sexually molested, pierced by needles and given unspecified drugs.

A senior People's Liberation Army (PLA) official on Friday denied that the kindergarten has any links with the Chinese military.

The kindergarten was not operated by the army or relatives of soldiers, and soldiers were not involved in the alleged molestation of children, Feng Junfeng, political commissar of a regiment of the PLA Army, told the PLA Daily Friday.

Feng said the kindergarten's head was a relative of a veteran of the regiment.

Audio and video recordings, in which children claimed they were forced to take pills to sleep and given physical examinations by some ""uncle and grandpa doctors,"" with one allegedly being naked, went viral Thursday, sparking public outrage.

Some netizens claimed that the kindergarten was allegedly run by Feng's regiment, and even soldiers from the regiment had allegedly molested children.

RYB Education responded Friday, saying that the company has provided documents and surveillance footage to police, and that the teachers allegedly involved have been suspended.

The company also told police it has been falsely accused and framed by some people. The company added it would apply a zero tolerance policy on those who violate professional ethics. 

Founded in 1998, RYB Education is based in Beijing and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It has more than 1,300 daycare centers and nearly 500 kindergartens in 300 cities in China, according to its website.

RYB Education's shares fell by 47.21 percent to $14.10 in pre-opening trading Friday after dropping 3.68 percent to $26.71 at the close of trading on Wednesday.

The media has reported alleged child abuse cases at other kindergartens as well. A teacher at a kindergarten in Zhenjiang, East China's Jiangsu Province reportedly punched the heads and pulled the ears of children. The local education bureau said Thursday the teacher who allegedly committed the acts has been suspended, the Nanjing-based newspaper Modern Express reported.

Now Singed's daughter as Zac is nice theory, it quite fits with what Singed can make, but I also think Viktor will help out Singed to recreate his daughter as Orianna, after he makes Blitzcrank and realises Blitzs developed self-conscious.

Twitch would probably make himself a bow by himself and heid part of rat colony which could attack the Firelights.

Ekko and Heimerdinger could make a Z-Drive, Ekko would become more reckless with it until either Twitch, Warwick or Dr. Mundo kill his friend Scar (the maked Vastaya in the show) and he would try and try to turn back time but ends up with malfunctioning Z-Drive 

I think Mel's armour will deflect the rocket and send it back at upper side of Zaun, since rocket is a literal nuke, and since most of Zaun is mining colony, it could lead to an earthquake which sends most of upper Zaun down because of hollow earth below.

Most of Zaun is made of pipes and never finished Air purifier and fans (where Jinx made her base) and with most of the pipes breaking it could release toxic gasses into air where Janna will come as a wind and redirect most of the gasses but most of the air is already pollutef and air is making people sick.

Now Viktor, seeing the council won't dare to help Zanuties because they felt attacked, would feel disgusted and would go down there and go help people with his hexclaw with removing the rubble, in process making Blitzcrank to help him.

Seeing the sick people where no medicine is helping and with most of shimmer production destroyed, it would leave him with only way to help these people, with the hexcore. He would go up to Piltover and try to take the hexcore, but Jayce won't allow him and they will have a fight which Viktor, who already augmented himself into a machine Herlard, wins and takes hexcore back to Zaun

He will start turning people into cyborgs, helping them but removing their humanity out of them, Jayce will at one point come down and see what Viktor is doing and thinking that Viktor is either killing the people or turning them into a perfect army to attack Piltover. They have a fight which Jayce wins by destroying the whole building with his hammer, it ends with Viktor standing over the dead people Jayce killed and swear veagance for people they promised to help so long ago.

For Vi, Caitlyn, Jinx and Warwick I have my ideas but will do them in the other comment

For Swain and Urgot, Swain sent Ugrot there into a trap during his time of taking down Darkwill's people and Noble houses which won't kneel to him, one of them being Merdarda's. Now since you mentioned the Black Rose, I can see one of LeBlanc's clones managing to get into the councyand convincing Piltover and Jayce to start making weapons for Merdarda's, after all, everyone is Pale woman's enemy with benefits

Now Graves in Stillwater Hold is quite Genius! I love it and I don't need to argue it :)

Now since Piltover is making weapons, it could lead to Camille now turning herself into a weapon herself and start killing anyone threatening the status queue. 

Since we know there are people buying Piltovan weapons in Ionia, Shen's father releases Jhin and sends him to Piltover to send a message for them to stop sending weapons to Ionia, which could make Camille investigate who is killing the rich nobles and lead to their fight in the theatre",MarkoNator11,2023-03-07,Ireland

One thing I struggle with while selling options for longer swing trades is my position sizing. I started trading with this method when we were already in ""day trading mode"", so I have a very good sense of how to size intraday and short term swing positions and how much is reasonable to lose on one of those trades, but I don't have a good sense of how to size positions relative to my account when I am selling a cash secured put or a bullish put spread. 

I am still just live trading one contract, but I am also copying the trades in a paper account to get a feel for how I will trade my account when I size up and I don't have a very good sense of how much of a portfolio to allocate to a single bullish put spread, or how much of an account to have exposed to sold options is too much.

I know that one of the advantages of a high win rate strategy like a BPS is that you can enter with strong size (and strong size seems necessary with how few of them you get per year relative to day trades), but I'm still trying to figure out what that optimal size is when accounting for the addition of overnight risk.",ZanderDogz,2023-02-17,Ireland

I’ve been feeling the exact same at times lately: tough intraday range with much of the movement happening in off hours. Multiple days this week alone have provided drastic intraday reversals that I can’t make sense of. 

For this reason most of my wins recently have come from “baby swings”, holding somewhere between 1-3 days for a trade. That said, it’s forced me to be selective in avoiding some names like Tesla that could be prone to significantly gap against me.

As a beginning trader in his second year, it's tough to notice when the market is entering a new phase so this helps a lot.

At the risk of breaking your advice on news, I found this article from the Economist on fed tightening to be really interesting: https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/02/15/investors-expect-the-economy-to-avoid-recession

It talks about how 6 of the last 8 tightening cycles have resulted in recessions. ""Before each of the hard landings, share prices began to rally, in some cases for up to a year."" but then it all fell apart. I like this article because of the contrasting perspective against a lot of the news. At the end of the day I'll follow price but I'm also looking to expand my knowledge at every opportunity... so learning how things like TLT and yield curves work is in my to-do list.

I started a 6-week swing trade experiment in January with a small sub-PDT account trading only 1 share of stock, just to see if I could. It really forced me to look at the D1 charts the same way I look at the M5 and to be more rigorous with my trend analysis.

One thing I was surprised to discover was that many stocks will often continue in their original direction from the previous day but will ultimately shift to follow SPY after the opening candle or two. This is when I most often took profits to hedge against SPY's uncertainty (unless the stock had high rvol). I really wanted to swing for 3-5 days but found that my winrate dropped on trades that exceeded 2 days.

I've learned a lot in OS chat. It is starting to come together for me, finally, and the proof is in my winrate. Thanks for everything!",OldGehrman,2023-02-17,Ireland

*If we put this space show in parallel with the star wars program we get this: combination of electromagnetic radiation and hypnosis which have also been the subject of intensive research. In 1974, for instance, researcher G. F. Shapits, said of one of the research proposals that, ‘…in this investigation it will be shown that the spoken words of the hypnotist may also be converted by electromagnetic energy directly and to the subconscious part of the human brain without employing any mechanical device for receiving or transcoding the message, and without the person exposed to such influence having a chance to control the information input consciously. It may be expected that the rationalized behaviour will be considered to have been taken out of their own free will.’*

*Anyone investigating so-called ‘channelling’ phenomena right now would be wise to take this area of research into consideration*\*. It will be noted that those who think of themselves as ‘channellers’ has escalated rapidly since this type of research was conducted. It is uncanny how similar their messages are, despite which entity they claim to be their source of divine guidance. It would suggest any individual considering the credibility of channelled information should be discerning and critically evaluate where the message they are receiving originates, and if the messages are specifically beneficial to the new world order.

*The Sydney Morning newspaper published an item on March 21st, 1983 which announced that the Soviets were invading the human mind, the article having been submitted to the foreign editor by* ***Doctor Nathan Abnuengy***, assistant professor in the faculty of agriculture in Asia. It is worth quoting the article at length even though his grammar is a little old. This article relates to the Soviets who created the supercomputer we were discussing earlier and which is really important because these types of computers can be run through satellites and through space. The computers were fed with all the different languages and their meanings, the dialect of all people were fed to the computers with objective programs. But we are no longer talking about the Soviets; we are talking about the ***United Nations***, the minions of the new world order, who are feeding the computers with the necessary information.

*The editor of the column in which the article appeared even states that the piece made points too important to ignore. I think it is possible that the persons who have created this mega-mind-control-program could sell the software to an organization and not be aware that the client might use the program and data to enslave all of humankind.

Teaching Council AND Requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/112tg24/mageocracy_of_allund_version_15/,Mageocracy of Allund version .15,"Districts  
The mageocracy of Allund is divided into about a thousand districts. Each district centers on a 'mage tower'... a construction designed to concentrate the mana throughout the district. Each district is seeded with special bars made of magically reactive materials... Spellsteel, Mage Bone, and Mana Crystal are all popular materials. These bars collect mana around them and transmit it to the central tower, from whence it is distributed to registered mages living and working in the district according to the wishes of the Mage Administrator.  
Typically they're set to passive collection, but they can be set to actively pump mana from the land in times of need, or to return mana to the land in order to encourage greater fertility and growth.  
The problem is that there are far more mages than districts. There are also more Administrators than districts. As such there's something of a post-graduate waiting list, but there are ways to bypass it. How did you get your district?  
\[\]Colonization  
You offered to colonize a 'new' district. This might mean reclaiming a previously ruled district from Bandits, taking control of a district ruled by 'Nobility', reclaiming a district destroyed by demons (or reckless mages), or setting up a whole new district in the wastes.  
\[\]Inheritance  
Schooling involves a few years of mentorship. In your case, your mentor was a Mage Administrator who took a liking to you. They took you under their wing, and eventually they stepped down and let you start running the district.  
\[\]Dead Man's shoes  
You murdered, assassinated, or otherwise removed everyone in line ahead of you for the district you were interested in. This is considered acceptable behavior, so long as you don't get caught.  
\[\]The Wait  
You just patiently waited your turn, like a good little pawn with no ambition.  
Which district did you acquire?  
\[\]Szenna's Sacrifice  
(Must be colonized)  
A blasted eastern badlands, this was the location of the original dark portal to the demon's lands. The source of the demonic invasion, and the place where Szenna died destroying the portal. The land is contaminated with magic and blood, and produces twisted and foul monsters. There are rumors of demons living, hidden, among the populace, and the spirits that inhabit this land have been dealing with an invasion of their own by blood-spirits from beyond the demonic gate.  
Ghosts still dot the land, the remains of the large scale of loss of life, as do ruins of formerly prosperous mage towers and towns. Once this was 25 different, highly populated, districts. Now it's one.  
The gate is smashed, but it's legacy lives on.  
\[\]Spartan Crossing  
(Must be colonized)  
Spartan Crossing is a dusty central district, located in the badlands between mountains. Mining is a viable source of resources, and the rains come often, allowing for a certain amount of fishing and aquaculture.  
An irregularly shaped district, Spartan Crossing formerly served as a major highway and crossroads between several prosperous districts. Now it's a haven for bandits, rebels, and outlaws. Most of the infrastructure to rule is still there, but damaged and dilapidated, and what soil there is has long been watered with blood.  
Take control of the district, and bring it back into the fold.  
\[\]Ermine Peaks  
A chilly place to the south, the Ermine Peaks are a collection of valleys nestled between tall mountains. The area is often described as a living taiga, and the locals make most of their money off of trapping and processing the silky furs of local foxes and minks.  
There is rumor of gold out in the hills, a precious mineral that's valuable for it's usage in certain alchemical constructs.  
This untamed expanse still has a collection of 'nobles' and a 'royal family' that works closely with the local mage administrator, assisting in the more tedious parts of management, leadership, and accounting.  
\[\]Blood Cove  
A coastal district to the west, blood cove is shaped like a giant claw reaching into the ocean, wthe isthmus that once connected the northern and southern halves of the cove having collapsed into the ocean at it's former narrowest point.  
The cove itself is shallow and well sheltered from the ocean, and home to several smaller fishing villages. The rest of the coast is sheer cliffs, and not suitable to serve as shipping launch points.  
Most costal trade currently bypasses the cove.  
\[\]Shadowsand  
An unpleasant desert to the north, the shadowsands are corrupted by some sort of unusual elemental corruption. This corruption, unsurprisingly, is focused around shadows and darkness. It severely and negatively affects mana-transmission in the area, often cutting the tower off from wide swaths of the lands.  
That being said, there's rumor that there's another civilization of mages to the north, past the shifting sands, and occasionally traders and merchants can make it through the desert bringing trinkets and alchemical artifacts of unknown make and origin.  
\[\]The Wode  
A central district the Wode was formerly ruled by the Druid of the Woe, Ypsilanti Moss, a witch sighted elementalist of great fame and power, the Wode is an intimidating district full of enormous trees, many of which are larger around than a prosperous merchant's house.   
There's four separate layers of canopy, each cutting off more light than the one before, and the bottommost layer of the wode is a shadowy land illuminated by a combination of mana crystals and bioluminescent fungi. The whole area teams with life, but is also very difficult for human life to tame: Giant insects are among the less dangerous biomantic experiments found in the Wode.  
The humans in the wode possess unusual features as a result of biomantic experimentation by the Druid of Woe ranging from animal features to enhanced senses and musculature. They need these features to survive in this temperate jungle.  
\[\]Vivid Creek  
(Not avalible for Colonization)  
A central district  
Vivid Creek is a heavily populated district. Most of the population is concintrated in the central city built around the old mage tower, with the remainder of the district being utilized for farming and a collection of smaller villages. The creek that gives the district it's name is pure, clean, and used to power hydrological mills, drop hammers, and other industry in the central city.  
It's one of the few districts in the mageocracy to boast a city of notable industry and splendor, but it also means that most of the mana that the tower processes is human mana. All mana has impurities, but human mana's impurities are more likely to have an effect on the human using it... typically emotional contamination.  
Having the tower so close to so many humans also makes the peasants born here more likely to grow up to be able to manipulate magic themselves.  
\[\]Alabaster Cliffs  
(Not Avalible for Colonization)  
A central district known for it's extreme verticality, the Alabaster Cliffs are carved into five tiers of cliffs and mesas. The extremely vertical city boasts a very large population of scholars, and three competing universities.   
It also boasts a large population of very dangerous priests, several unions, and a bizarrely strong anti-pathy to witches. Their fractious population are more than happy to get in the face of a mage administrator they believe is leading them astray, and very few of the administrators of the city have survived to retirement, sporting a life expectancy of administrators that is one and a half times SMALLER than that of the average non-administrative mage.",BlindGardener,2023-02-15,Ireland

No one really questions why they are a mage during the demon war.  An army invaded through a magical portal, using magic to fight it just made sense.  You were tested to see if you were fit for duty, and if you tested positive for magic you reported for training.  **Water** seemed like a good element to study, even if demons are fireproof a big enough wave could push them back into the portal.

That was not “Plan A,” the portal was not near a convenient body of water.  Trained soldiers went in first, this is what they were trained for.  Earth mages were a close second, they needed time to prepare, but supported soldiers by giving them walls to hide behind if “pointy sticks” were not the answer to Interdimensional invaders.

Muscle wizard casts fist, and pointy stick does not beat physiomancer.  The earth walls became strategically important, as did the big rocks that were being catapulted in.  If pointy sticks don’t work, someone usually starts yelling something about “kill it with fire.”  Like the rocks, the fireballs being thrown around put the soldiers at risk.   Moats are also good, and some soldiers can swim, though not the ones in heavy armor.

One of the nice things about being a water mage is that if things around the portal get bad enough, you can load everyone onto a boat.  Even if some demons can swim, it is usually not the ones in heavy armor, so whatever soldiers made it onto the boat have a better chance of defending the civilians.  Now Szenna is a hero, not meaning to disparage their noble sacrifice, but if fireballs don’t work apparently “Plan B” is an even bigger explosion.

The demon war ended before I did much more than get trained and wait for the orders that never came.  I had some time after that, so I trained in **Glass** while looking for a tower to administrate.  There’s a place in **Blood Cove** that used to be a land bridge.  With a little help from the local water mage, it can be a land bridge again.

People didn’t really stop using it as a land bridge, it just became “high risk, high reward.”  People who didn’t get bogged down in little details got bogged down in something else.  The water mage was willing to help out when someone’s wagon got stuck in the mud, but it began to be a bit of a bother.  It was also using up a lot of water magic.

I could also use the untouched Glass magic, and after a few years of training I **inherited** the lighthouse.  My teacher had a few tomes of **Lost Knowledge** laying around to tempt apprentices, though not for the reason you might think.  The light of the lighthouse was actually a fairly powerful weapon once you concentrated the beam on a target.  It is the kind of thing a bored mage might tinker with, and they needed someone who would not immediately go tattling to the council, but also not hold a fishing village for ransom with their “death ray.”  The earliest books of lost knowledge were just local gossip, beaches are romantic and you might be shocked what you can learn about people’s “private lives” with a lighthouse and a telescope.

My teacher wasn’t looking for “shocked,” which usually leads to wanting to tell someone.  I wasn’t really interested, I was a mage devoted to the study of magic.  Besides, it wasn’t like there were any pictures.  My teacher got some other books, on alchemy and physiomancy.  They were filled with the kind of knowledge that had gotten other people killed, but I didn’t turn my teacher in to the mages council.

One day we were doing maintenance of the lighthouse light.  I had already figured out it was a weapon, and made sure the safety was on.  My teacher asked me to do something that might have gotten me killed if I didn’t carefully duck under the “harmless” beam of light.  After the maintenance was finished, he took a short vacation and I was left with the books of Lost Knowledge.

Fascinating stuff, I learned how to use Glass magic to create the kind of laboratory glassware alchemists use in their experiments.  As nothing was burned down in their ”absence,” my teacher handed the **lighthouse** over to me.  Just in time for wagonloads of fresh produce to get ready to head across the land bridge.

As was tradition, the local water mage was given a cut of the profits earned by those who got their produce to market much sooner than the competition.  I also gave them some glass jars I made, to sell to people interested in canning their own produce for winter.  I can’t take credit for the jelly recipes, but the jelly jars did well enough at the farmers market to attract the attention of **Frauline** **Bouergone.**

She was an alchemist, which was sort of rare after the war due to the weapon designers on both sides being targeted by assassins.  She saw the reconstruction period as an opportunity, she wanted to reconstruct the way alchemy was done on Allund.  She was doing a big presentation to convince the mages council, and needed “a big glass display.”  I interrupted her vague description of the kind of “bottle” she wanted to ask if she wanted a round bottom flask.  A non-alchemist knowing the proper technical terms is rare, but the main reason I’m not an Alchemist is I don’t have the right materials.

She asked if I knew much about “Construction II,” which is sort of a trick question.  It is a word she made up to describe a subset of Alchemy she is trying to get recognized by the Mages Council.  I asked if she had any books on the subject, and she got me the journals of several alchemists.  None of them called their work Construction II, but it was representative of the kind of thing she wanted distinguished from “Potion-making.”

Now the description of Alchemy says that there is a machine that condenses mana into crystals.  Cross referencing with the Lost Knowledge of my teacher, the description of Demon Blooded mentions they can create corrupted mana/blood crystals.  There’s also apparently several ways to become artificially Demon Blooded.  They’re all dangerous since the demon blood will consume you from the inside out if you don’t have a regular supply.  There are ways to purge the demon blood from a mage, but what if we crystalized it?

According to the description of Witch Coven, ritual magic can use special tools to manipulate mana that the caster can’t sense.  Which is good because I think I need like five extra focuses to even attempt something like this.  Fortunately, I have an entire island to use as a ritual space, so I became a **Ritualist**.

Blood magic is not illegal, just “Artistic.”  The available material on the subject uses a lot of flowery language and can vary between practitioners.  Water magic has been codified since the Classical period and the Quintet modernized the language used.

Mazes/Sigils are hard to cover up considering entire ruins are actually one big magic symbol.  They can be used to add ”resonant effects,” and since I don’t have actual demon blood I need to somehow “taint” the blood I do have.  I created a “Moat” with a Wine magic Sigil and pretended the Blood magic books were ordered by mistake.    People stopped asking questions after that, but I can use water magic to redirect the flow and rewrite the sigil.

Crystalizing all of a person’s blood might kill them faster than the leftover demon blood, so we need the Alchemy machine to only crystalize the magically tainted blood.  We would need some sort of Biomancy just to figure out where on the body to attach the blood crystal machine.  Raising leeches in the water of a sigil moat simplified things since we just needed to put the blood crystallization machine on the back of the bloodsuckers.

No one in the setting seems to have figured out how to do a demon bone marrow transplant, and I’m not sure my character is on that level.  He can’t even make the blood crystallization machine small enough to fit on the back of regular leeches.  He had to use biomancy to make the leeches bigger.  It was shortly after the demon war, so the idea was to capture them in glass “cannonballs“ and shoot them at demons.",WheresMyEditButton,2023-02-16,Ireland

contrary to what i said eairlyer i sugest giveing some examples on what each elemental system can do for instance what is different betwenn clasic earth elementalism and quintet earth elementalism 

also what dose narative elementalism mean can i use constructive storytelling and the protagonism to give someone narative weight makeing them more likely to survive unethical experiment to give them magical powers, can i use the same process with destructive and antagonism to create their anthisis. in my opinion this should be its own focus in magic

Alchemy, Psychomancy, Spaciomancy, Chronomancy | -10

Alchemy is the core of my build, everything else is to support it. The essence of alchemy is to create and the highest profundity of creation is worlds. Yes, I plan to make worlds. (They would be kind of like small worlds in xianxia.) Spaciomancy and chronomancy cus a world needs space and time. Psychomancy to deduce how to make everything possible. I want biomancy, binding, and mazes/sigils, but I can only take only 4 focuses, so I'll study them myself.

**Personal Traits:**

Witch Sight, Personally Powerful, Lost knowledge, Ritualist | -40

What difference is there in magic from casting spells, things made from alchemy, and rituals? Nothing, it is just a matter of perspective. Making rituals illegal is stupid, no wonder mages got fucked by demons.

**Disadvantages:**

Artificial Witch Sight

1 or 2 witch eyes not enough? Just get more lmao. I'll make an object with alchemy that can have the same, probably even better, power as regular witch sight. As for witches hating me? Hehe, they have to know first.

**How did you get your district?:**

Colonization

**Which district did you acquire?:**

Ermine Peaks

Alchemy resources is good. I could probably bribe the 'nobles' and 'royal family' to ignore my research on binding and ritualism if they ever find out.

**Tower:**

Subterranean

Low defense is for the average mage scrubs. The special trait of subterranean towers is that they can cover much more area than other towers. I'll make full use of this trait and use my mage tower and my magic to stealthily construct a super formation/ritual (I guess formations would be a branch of ritualism? Or perhaps it would be the other way around? Formations like in xianxia.) with alchemy, binding, mazes/sigils, formations/ritualism, psychomancy, spaciomancy, and chronomancy. Unless a mage with higher attainment than me in all the types of magic I used to make the formation/ritual attacks me (I highly doubt someone of this caliber exists), the best mages in each type of these magics come together to attack me, or an insane amount of mages pool their power together and pay a huge price to send an attack that can overpower my defenses, I will be practically invincible.

**Friends and enemies:**

Frauline Bouergone, Riya Tonjam | -10

Both alchemists.

Teaching Council AND Requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/10diyfs/why_most_latter_day_saints_are_over_paying_their/,Why Most Latter day Saints Are Over paying Their Tithing By 1000s Of Dollars,"Rant ahead: 

I feel that it’s 10% of your *increase* which means *after* your basic needs are met. Food, shelter, clothing, etc. *Then* tithe on your extra; your gain. 

It’s kind of a weird concept. Case in point: most people have a car payment, paid for with dollars from work. That work money has been tithed on when received. How about people though who receive a company car for personal use? That’s easily worth $500 or more per month. So they don’t have a car payment, thus, no tithed money. Do TBMs pay tithing on the *value* of the company car? Do they add an extra $50/month? I would think not. 

Then again, if you are provided a company car, company home, free healthcare, free food… should you pay tithing? At all? After all, if everything is provided - say, in a position without a salary but every need you ever want is provided - you’d have no money to pay tithing. 

It also gets murky when you are self-employed. What is an increase? Which is why i feel that it’s up to the person and no one else. 

Personally, I feel that I should pay to what an amounts as a limited “user fee.” It makes you feel like you’re a “part” if that makes sense. After all, buildings do use electricity, and temples do need to be built. Yes, they have the funds, but it gives you a purpose in the church. (Donating time - service - counts too, IMO). 

That’s just my rule. My 10 year old son last night was talking about a mission. And that’s fine, his choice when the time comes. He was flabbergasted when he found out the church doesn’t pay (typically) the $500/month and that that responsibility first falls on the parents. 

As we know they aren’t hurting for money. People are. There’s nothing wrong about being generous but to have a certain percentage is wrong, considering the net worth of the church. Hell, if they said no more 10% and donate what you feel is right, they may even get *more* money from the rich, who have everything that they need. 

This gets into what’s “fair”. So many think a 10% flat tax is the answer (for federal taxes). But that’s not true, because food, shelter, and clothing is the same price for the poor as it is the rich. 10% of $50,000/yr is a hell of a lot more to a person than 10% of $500,000. A person making $500,000 pays tithing and makes $450,000. Does it actually hurt them? A poor person goes from $50k to $45k - that can be disastrous for someone barely making it. 

Paying tithing when your can’t pay rent is silly. Especially when you are receiving church assistance. Just pay it yourself. I *really* loathe this quote: “If paying tithing means that you can’t pay for water or electricity, pay tithing. If paying tithing means that you can’t pay your rent, pay tithing. Even if paying tithing means that you don’t have enough money to feed your family, pay tithing.” Seriously? 

I also recall a finance church from the church that met weekly. Actually, for the most part it was quite helpful. However, every week they would start with a 10 minute diatribe about PAY TITHING FIRST and it’s like OK! I’m literally not eating but tithing first. 

I have nothing against paying though if you feel that way. Not sure why withholding temple blessings is a result of not paying. Case in point: the word of wisdom clearly states meat in times of famine only. But no one enforces that, only the hot drinks and booze. Why is one chosen over the other? I read in the past that while tithing was a commandment, it wasn’t enforced to be prevented from entering the temple. Then it was, allegedly due to the church needing $$. Well, money isn’t needed now. Compound interest has made that unnecessary.

I remember my father bringing the family together about 5 or 6 years ago at Christmas time. In tears of gratitude, joy and bearing his testimony, he told this story of how one year he decided to pay 11% tithing (of gross) just to see if he could do it. Over the next decade he increased that to 20% tithing and was blessed more than he deserved and more than he thought possible because of his tithing. He stated that in his temple recommend interview he mentioned this to the bishop. The bishop had to tell him that the church requires 10% and that he should not be paying more than that in tithing. But was telling us this to bear his testimony of the true gospel on this earth and how the church was true.  

This actually explains why we had to pay for our own clothes, why we were malnourished, why he could not afford to pay for any of his kids to do extracurricular activities.  But I wonder how he was able to spend tens of thousands on guitars and musical equipment.  Must have been his tithe paying!",Chrelve,2023-01-16,Ireland

This sub is not going to like my answers hahaha.

Education - I would fully fund operations of all public schools (k-12) to its recomended student body and teaching staff size. I would also approve school vouchers to cover all expenses above that. If for some reason it is easier on you to have your kid in a school in another town, no worries. The school vouchers thoigh would not be transferable to private schools, and private schools would only be beholden to the government for testing of students om core subjects. Private schools that dont meet the minimum in core subjects would have their license revoked.

Universities would have 100% of funding for education cut. Your education will allow you to earn a higher wage then someone without it and its not upto those who didnt go to a secondary school to pay for your higher wage. Thats your problem.

Industry - no handouts to anyone, flat tax of all industries.

Healthcare - Model our system after many Euro systems and allow private companies to provide healthcare as well as continue with government run hospitals.

Indigenous issues - federal problem for reserves, eveyone not on a reserve is the same as anyone else.

Enviromental issues - I will follow the N.A.P. everyone will be 100% responsible for damages they cause. I would keep the carbon tax on industry and not on individuals, you should not be taxed to heat your house.  Will open up the closed trails that the NDP closed.

Nationwide Issues - I will 100% stand behind Albertans for Albertans first. I heavily believe in individual property rights and will fight against the feds on anything that violates them. Will completely ignore federal firearm laws and will have sheriffs arrest any RCMP officer who tries to seize private property.

Misc - I will end the current corporate socialist system, as well as remove many other handouts. Corporations are not individuals and are not granted individual rights.

Disabled people need not worry, I would merge the various provincial programs into AISH and increase payments. Those who scam the system will be required to 100% cost recovery as well as steep fines.

All drugs would be legal, once again ignoring federal laws. But drugs is no longer an excuse for any criminal activity, expect full prosecution. Rehab services will not be free, but would be subsidized to the point they are cheaper then drugs.

Expect that violation of provincial laws would mean heavy prosecution. But jails are for improvement as much as punishment. People would leave with the life skills needed to actually break free. Expect jail to be the only place you may get a 2 year diploma, or trades training for free, but you should not expect a TV or netflix in jail. Expect serious crimes to end with a woodchipper though...... pedos, rapists and 1st degree murder, the unredeamable.

It's offensive to me that places like the Stollery or any hospital has to beg for money every year to fund their efforts and facilities. Train more nurses and doctors. Open and fund more space for said training. Reduce red tape for doctors from other parts of the globe to begin practicing here.

Full education through high school. No more of this nickle and dimeing parents.

Flat tax above a certain amount. I would have to work the numbers but say the first 30k is tax free and everything else above that is taxed at 15%. No deductions. You make it, you pay tax on it. 

Regulate the number of hours businesses should give employees. Too many employers have all part time employees to avoid paying benefits, but want people to be available 24/7. Business should have a minimum percentage of full time employees with the rest as part time. This will reduce scheduling issues, turnover, and stress for workers.

Minimum wage hike to correspond to the above point. Working full time should include a living wage, so the minimum wage should reflect that.

Help fund cities properly. 

Stop being so antagonistic to other levels of governent, be that federal or civic.

Take back services that have been farmed out to private industry. Privatization is never cheaper so core services shouldn't be provided by private interests.

Since the federal government is constantly dragging its feet on indigenous issues, I would open dialog with indigenous leaders about how we can help build relationships and infrastructure. I would like to see more opportunities for education and cooperation from both sides. 

Start a provincial insurance program to provide auto insurance at a reasonable rate with a low to moderate profit margin. This would provide true competition to the current providers and help them regulate their rates without actually regulating their rates. If a provincial plan is offering the same coverage as a private plan but is markedly cheaper, the private plans will have to lower their rates or lose a large number of market share.

Negotiate higher royalties with resource extraction companies. We give our resources away and they reap record profits. Time for that to equalize a bit. Put money back into the heritage fund so when oil does take a dip we don't have to slash and burn services to balance the books.

Industry-I would provide incentives for energy companies to invest in alternative energy plans (solar, wind, geothermal etc), as well as incentives for less equipment powered 100% by combustion engines. There would be a crack down on cleaning up orphan wells. Potentially looking into these abandoned wells for geothermal energy. Also no coal expansion into our rockies. Not sure if its federal or provincial but I would also like to see way more if not all of the industry money in Canada stay here

Healthcare- I won't pretend to know enough about the flaws in our health care and how to fix them. I know our nurses are severely under paid and under appreciated. I would like to bring back incentives for doctors and nurses to work in more remote areas.

Indigenous-Again I won't pretend to be an authority on this issue. For sure there needs to be a lot of healing done. I would like to provide more education opportunities, and social programs to help aboriginal communities. While not entirely an aboriginal issue our justice system disproportionally affects aboriginal so i would like to see prison systems go to more of a rehabilitation system rather then punishment

Environment for industry- As said crack down on orphan wells. Any pollution a company causes is 100% on their dime and time to clean up. No if, ands or buts. Actually enforce a lot of the environmental laws we have in regards to industry. Stricter and tougher fines along with more people hired to check up and watch these companies (that aren't being paid for by the companies). I would also like to offer far greater incentives to land owners to put conservation easements on native prairie. 

Environment for recreation-I would like to see more parks but instead of letting them become cooperate towns like Banff only allow the bare minimum of development for those maintaining and visiting the park. In other words more wild land expansion. This land could be still be used for camping, hunting, fishing etc in most cases. The only exception being if an area is considered highly sensitive or needing to recover. Any of the crown land passes should go back into conservation.

Nationwide concerns-pressuring the government into purring a freeze on foreign companies buying up land and resources. Let that money stay within Canada for our benefit even if its through crown companies. I would also like to see more action on climate change and other environmental topics. Also stand firmly against the federal governments gun grab that affects the absolutely wrong people.

I believe that dumping pollutants into the sea is wrong and so I sought out my current position.  I am still researching my third and fourth focus.

From the looks of it, the council would be controlled by an “inner council” of single focus mages, who tend to be the strongest.

However, it is possible to deplete an area of magic, especially if you are focusing on a specific type.  This would mean that single focus mages would be better off if they could rotate towers.  For example, a fire mage moving to the old tower of a water mage whose land still had abundant fire energy.

However, even to mages there are more reasons to value a piece of land than the available magical energy.  An earth mage could prevent soil depletion, which means more crops could be grown in the soil.  Abundant crops can not only feed the populace, it creates opportunities to trade.  Excess crops are traded between different communities, bringing in not only money but stories from different lands and new ideas.  What would happen if a mage wanted to keep enjoying the money and other luxuries?

The setting already records wars happening, the simplest to understand would probably be between the Classic and the Quintet.  A single focus mage is likely served by a group of dual focus mages.  We’ve discussed some benefits of earth mages, but air mages may be able to control the weather to make farming and travel easier.  If several dual focus mages donated part of their air magic to a single focused air mage, the weather over a wide area can be controlled.  The energy would not be depleted as quickly and could be restored on a more predictable schedule.  Allund could be divided into four “kingdoms” of roughly equal size under the Classical system.  Quintet includes Life magic as a fifth school, and likely grew out of the idea that the people living in the land should have some say on when mages rotate and where they live.

The way the peace negotiations went after the war, mages didn’t have to actually give “peasants” a vote as long as they took their feelings into consideration.  Some forms of mismanagement hurt the mages who would use the tower afterward rotating, to say nothing of the peasants suffering under such tyranny.  The Quintet had a larger army by virtue of being more popular with the people who volunteered as soldiers and dedicated Life mages kept the army from getting smaller.

Around the dual-focus mages surrounding the single focus members of the inner council, there exists a “buffer” of mage administrators.  Instead of focusing on specific magical elements, they were out there to listen to the requests of non-mages.  A successful harvest festival requires rain for crops to grow as well as nice weather for the festival itself, so coordinating the many different requests required some “administration.“  If the administrator needed the request to be approved by ”the Council,” it gave the mages involved time to find a solution that might make everyone happy.  Requests for magical healing were the most common, so “Life mages” made up a large part of the population of all four Classical nations before defecting to form a fifth of the Quintet.

Members of the Classical faction were worried Allund was on a slippery slope to what became the Salem Witch Trials on our world.  Trying to get both sides to agree on what human rights violations would allow peasants to banish a mage was prolonging a war that was killing the very people they were trying to help.  Besides, the mage would leave in a few years either way.  Some mages were not satisfied with the compromise even though their “side“ won, and supplied non-mages with various forms of protection.  Alchemy that could protect against Psychomancy, Sigils that put limits on the energy that could be absorbed from the land, even training some non-mages as Ritualists.  Ordinary people didn’t mind having these, the nobility were willing to pay for them, and bandits were more than willing to steal them.

As a result of this, there has been talking about increasing the buffer to include guardians as well as administrators.  The problem is how to adequately supply guardians in the field with magic despite unpredictable conditions.  Broad focus and previously untapped elements are preferable for this even if they are not as strong as traditional mages.  Before this, mages dealt with the superior number of non-mages with overwheming power, but under the Quintet the possibility of encountering “pseudo-mages” who had both numbers and magical support became a very real concern.  It was enough to end the Classical period, but only time will tell if the Quintet will survive having its greatest strength turned against it.

I think that where you end up should partially depend on what magic you know.  For example, there is such a thing as Desert Elemental magic.  However, the trade I mentioned in discussing Earth Magic and Air Magic means that forest mages, mountain mages, and seaside mages have already been able to compare notes.  Mountain Earth Magic is good at controlling rocks like an avalanche while Valley Earth Magic or “Palace Earth Magic” is good at enriching the soil.  So good that modern mages use the best techniques of multiple styles and just call it “earth magic.”  A single focus mage likely has understanding of two to four regional styles even if the difference would be hard to explain to non-mages or even mages with less focus on the subject matter.",WheresMyEditButton,2023-02-13,Ireland

I will also use a scattering of other systems but these are what I'm studying and planning on using in concert

Sorcery: my focus with sorcery will deal with fusing raw arcane power into things and then using the life element magic to cause that power to become permanent fusing it into the very DNA of that life.

Alchemy: I would use the powerful magical reagents that I create with weird and interesting properties 

A rose infused with a large amount of mana and the property of the order can continue to grow naturally. That can be used to give flavor spells with the property of order.

An apple tree grows fruit infused with the fire element that can create apple juice that has the power of fire as a base potion component.

A blackberry bush that has perpetually frozen fruit that is still alive.

Etc.

Biomancy: this would allow me to more accurately direct and apply changes made with my magic as well as use it to make the changes inheritable.



Personal traits ;

Witch sight: witches can see, hear, and interact with spirits, gods, and ghosts.

Witch covens: you have a family of magic users who come from classical witch backgrounds. They consider themselves a coven of witches and practice the traditions inherent to their roots.

Familiar: you have a familiar spirit bound to my soul. It is helpful and follows you around. It can travel freely on any land you claim, but When outside your land it has to remain close enough to you to be able to sense your presence. My familiar is a life elemental spirit who has long resided in my coven they were bound to my mother before me and told the coven they wanted to bind themselves to me when my mother died. After binding to me their paradigm shifted to live from my water which it was when it was bound to my mother. (if possible) 

My father also had his own familiar that bound itself to me, his was an elemental of steel. However, when they moved to me they shifted their paradigm into a spirit of the order.

Shortly after m birth, my coven managed to entice a spirit of chaos into being a familiar, they said that their covenant was that they need to bond to someone who would balance them as there was one who was bonded to order.

Personal power: your power puts you in the top half of a tenth of a percent of mages. Putting you roughly half as far beyond your average fellow administrator as they are beyond the average non-administrative mage.

lost knowledge:  you’ve acquired a fiat share of lost and forbidden knowledge, and know more about the history of the magistracy than you should. On one hand, that means that you perceive many situations with the scales off your eyes, allowing for a more truthful assessment of relationships and interactions with the natives. On the other hand, it makes interactions with other mages seem more shallow and less real, especially as you must keep much of your knowledge hidden, as it’s not permitted to distribute widely.

Ritualist: as a mage, you don’t need ritual magic. You cannot be separated from your means of casting magic, and if there’s no mana to use you won’t be able to cast magic any better with a ritual than you will naturally. That being said, you were fascinated with rituals and learned about, practiced, and event-developed rituals while you were at school.
To maintain their monopoly on magic. The magocracy has declared that it is illegal to teach magic to a non-mage… but you know to do so. The punishment for doing so depends on several factors and ranges from a fine for teaching a servant a ritual or two to allow them to assist you, to exile for teaching an army unit battle magic ritually… if you get caught
(Innately magical reagents should allow me to bypass the need for access to mana)

District : 

You [inherited] your district of the [wode] forest district which contains the mage tower called the [forest heart] created by the original maker of the [wode].

The forest heart: the heart of the forest is an ancient grove of trees with a mana-collection system interwoven into them. This mana pump is capable of significant self-repair. It also synergizes with biomantic mages, allowing them to command the plants of the tower almost as an extension of their own body.",thekingofmagic,2023-02-14,Ireland

you park a colossus outside friendly or neutral planets and use a bombard/assist research-like button which deploys benefits to the planet and its owner.

for example, a Megacorp Colossus which is a massive roving theme park, gives big happiness and amenities bonuses, maybe a diplo bonus, ethics attraction, whatever, and the owner of the colossus gets credits.

Prophets teaching racist concepts:

“Oh, so the philosophies of men mingled with scripture?”

Joseph Smith and other leaders marrying teenaged girls, other mens wives, etc:

“Oh, so they taught and practiced the philosophies of men mingled with scripture.”

The list is endless but this reply could be used anytime a previous church leaders taught  something that is now dismissed as “opinion” or imperfect men or things of the time.

Teaching Council AND Requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/111hppc/the_philosophies_of_men_mingled_with_scripture/,The Philosophies of Men Mingled with Scripture,"> Frankly, there doesn’t seem to be any authoritative source that actually spells out what is meant by the phrase “the philosophies of men.” 

This is because it's not a definition. It's a posture. 

The ""philosophies of men"" are what we look down on from *our* position possessed of the counter-concept the ""wisdom of God."" It doesn't matter what the ""philosophies of men"" are, and this is why they're rarely if ever defined. The central matter of importance is that *we know better*. The phrase exists as part of a set of statements about the superiority of church teachings and authority. It doesn't really have any other purpose, and even if someone offered a definition, it would probably change over time where needed to accommodate that purpose.

I do think that most members of the church would probably accept some working definition like ""mortal reasoning"", though. And I also think you're correct at an analytical level that anyone who *can* be ""speaking as a man"" will inevitably mingle mortal reasoning with the wisdom of God. And that means ""the philosophies of men mingled with scripture"" are all we have, really, because even the scriptures themselves are composed by mortals, and even if they were perfect, they're read by mortals doing mortal reasoning when reading them. 

There's a margin of hope for transcending it when it comes to the influence of the spirit, and the church usually leans into that. I'm one to accept that certain extra-rational capacities are helpful in wise understanding & behavior, so I respect that on a practical level. But what I wish the church would do is lean into the part of its theology that fully accepts that one can't merely rely on feelings, one needs ""studying it out in ones mind"" and learning from the best books and other things that are in fact the work of mortal reasoning and therefore overlap with ""philosophies of men"" and stop disparaging them.

And I expect that to the degree that the church cares about maximizing light and knowledge over maximizing status and authority, that's even a possible path forward.",westonc,2023-02-13,Ireland

What ""flavor"" of law won out in your own life and why?","I conducted my B.A. senior project studying Jewish Christianity. In it, I think that I demonstrate that we see 2 different groups within early Christianity. These groups respectively, are Gentile Christianity, and Jewish Christianity. Jewish christians are designated so, because they express their honor to the God of Israel and and loyalty to Jesus as Lord through traditional Jewish institutions: including participation in the temple cult, Observance of sabbath, and circumcision, and general adherence to the Torah. Gentile christians, are different in that they express loyalty to the God of Israel and to Jesus as Lord outside of traditional Jewish institutions. As we see in the book of Galatians, the apostle Paul is is loathe to allow his community to participate or be swayed by Jewish expressions of faith. This demonstrates that early Christianity is diverse. 

 But I would argue that the concern for historically grounding your faith is unfounded.  The Christian religion has always been a product of evolution, and faith has never relied on history alone. Because of this, I'm unsure, as a practice in Christian, that our 1st model for faith should be ""how they did it in ancient times"": this is because our faith is simply a product of evolution, one that we should respect.",MelancholyHope,2022-06-25,Ireland

This isn't a fair comparison and people know it.

You can attend a wedding and not agree that the couple should get married, whether it's because you hate gay people, hate one of the people getting married, or just think that it's a bad match. 

Being gay is a personal variable that ultimately affects exactly one person - the person who is gay.

Attending a gay wedding does not require any change of belief system or imposed self-guilt or altered moral stance. Converting to Christianity requires all of those things. Homosexuality is also a provable thing that doesn't require any ""faith"", unlike religion.

Also, a very dear family member of mine is very devoted to her church and is also a lesbian. Those things are not mutually exclusive. Unless you want the missionaries to be the ""gays are bad but we'll pray for them"" variety?",GaimanitePkat,2022-11-08,Ireland

Remember following the Ratburn thing. It was a big deal in my state where locations decided to pull it. Some were pushing for taking PBS off public airwaves completely.

So I decided to watch the episode myself. Ratburn marriage was mostly in the background of the show. It was more about Arthur and his friends trying to get Mr. Ratburn from being less strict or something. There wasn't any life lesson around gay marriage. Just acknowledgement that it was normal and part of life. Never did it once felt pushy or contrived on the subject matter. I watched Arthur growing up. This is what Arthur does best. The ""life lessons"" are tied organically to the story so kids can have fun with the show while subtly digesting the underlining messages. 

The nuts who tried to pull the episode had absolutely nothing to worry about.

Those that die as citizens of good standing are interred in a special building. Elections are conducted for the ruler every 10 years. The dead are contacted via magic to place votes. Unresponsive dead that have ""moved on"" are interred in a cemetery.

Appointment: The ruler is appointed by a committee given ""and other duties as required"" powers by a long dead King/Queen. This ""election"" is technically a hereditary monarchy and all authority is derived through the long dead monarch.

Election: Vote tournament. There is a multi round vote conducted to choose the next ruler. At first, every adult votes, but after that only round winners vote. Every adult starts out as a candidate and the elections are extremely localized. Increase the rounds by one everytime you increase the order of magnitude of the population. Each round moves the votes from local (same street) closer to national. There is 10 days between each round of voting, where voters are expected to research each candidate. There is 20 days before the final round.

For a 100,000-999,999 population:

i. Everyone votes in a group of 10. The candidates are adults on their street/block/floor. This leaves 10,000- 99,999 winners.

ii. Every winner votes in a group of 10.  This leaves 1000-9999 winners.

iii. Every winner votes in a group of 10. This leaves 100-999 winners.

iv. The winners vote in another group of 10. This leaves 10-99 winners.

v. The 10-99 winners vote on the final election. The top 10 are chosen for a follow on vote. The follow on vote occurs the very next day and each of the 10-99 may submit a ranked choice for the remaining 10. The winner is elected the new ruler for the following 10 years.",lumo19,2023-02-12,Ireland

The first thing you need to ask, will changing to paper even be better?

1. Paper straws are made from wood effectively, wood / cardboard etc will take some level of energy to make into straws, they are not carbon neutral. The comparison is complex and I wouldn't be surprised if paper is actually worse.

2. Recycling - many ""paper"" straws are laminated in some way, this makes them mixed recycling in such a way that they are impractical to recycle at all, you'd be better off with plastic because it's one material that you could potentially recycle

3. Composting - many ""paper"" alternatives aren't as compostable as you'd think, laminated paper doesn't go anywhere fast.

4. Effectiveness at the job, if the average person used two paper straws then even if they are 10% better per straw they are actually 80% worse per use.

5. Is there an alternative that's way better than the two options - no straw options, metal straws, biodegradable plastics etc.",New-Topic2603,2022-12-21,Ireland

It supports the fallacy of global warming/ climate change to tell us what to do:
Stop using middle East oil, start putting money into West owned nuclear businesses.
That's what is behind. Remember that this planet had glaciations and very hot climates without human intervention. There's no ""planet thermostat"" and if there is, we can't touch it.

Some years ago, supermarkets stopped giving plastic bags. So good for the environment. I now feel so eco with my £1 bags but then when I come home with the shopping, tomatoes, grapes and strawberries come in plastic boxes, leeks, potatoes, lettuces and cabbages in plastic bags. Meat in plastic trays, chicken or fish in plastic bags. Water and juices in plastic bottles. And so on.
Overall, if one takes the exercise of coming home with a typical weekly shopping and immediately start separating all plastic packaging and weighing it, it would make a number of grams, maybe 30, maybe 50. If now we weigh a carrier bag, I think it takes 4 or 5 to make a single gram. That's the actual saving, ladies and gentlemen. There is no real will to make a real change, is all smoke and mirrors.

***

(**SIDEBAR:** Consider that Littlefinger's man Ser Morgarth is the Elder Brother of Quiet Isle. Meanwhile, for some reason GRRM wanted the High Sparrow — a ""small spare man""; ""shorter than the queen by several inches and as thin as a broom handle""; with a ""sharply pointed"" face, a ""sharp face and a short beard, grizzled grey and brown""; ""sharp-featured"", with ""hard eyes"" — to bear a passing similarity to Littlefinger, who has ""sharp features"", whose eyes don't smile when his mouth does, who is ""small"", ""short"", ""slight"", ""slender"", with a ""pointed chin beard"" and ""threads of silver in his dark hair"". Does Littlefinger have an elder brother, in addition to 'his' Elder Brother? **END**)

The overthrow of Harmund and the mutilation of his Lannister mother by the Shrike and Hagon leads to a war between the ironborn and the Lannisters. The results sound like the results of 'Petyr's' war in the Riverlands:
>The war between the ironborn and the westermen continued in a desultory fashion for five more years, finally ending in an exhausted peace that left the Iron Islands impoverished, burned, and broken. The winter that followed was long and harsh, and is remembered on the isles as the Famine Winter. Hake tells us that three times as many ironmen perished of starvation that winter than had died in the battles that preceded it.

A famine in winter? Why, that's just what Petyr's gearing up to profit from with the grain-stockpiling scheme he's launched in the Vale c. *TWOW Alayne I*:
>[Petyr:] ""Post guardsmen on the docks. If need be, seize the ships. How does not matter, so long as no food leaves the Vale.""

>""These prices, though,"" protested fat Lord Belmore,"" these prices are more than fair.""

>""You say more than fair, my lord. I say less than we would wish. Wait. If need be, buy the food yourself and keep it stored. Winter is coming. Prices must go higher.""

Thus the Shrike's sept-burning, lie-decrying, famine-inducing rebellion seems to rework events of *ASOIAF*, including the burning of Riverland septs, traceable to Petyr's Big Little Lie. But that's not the only thing I think it's doing. (""All things come round again"", again.)


###The Shrike's Rebellion & King's Landing in *ACOK*
I submit that the Shrike-fueled grassroots rebellion and the burning of the septs is *also* a kaleidoscopic reworking of motifs found around Petyr's machinations to destabilize King's Landing by inflaming its population c. *ACOK*. Consider that Petyr's first move is to impose an ironbornishly ""clever and cruel"" tax on refugees:
>""Lord Littlefinger… has imposed a tax on those wishing to enter the city.""

>""Yes, that would work,"" Tyrion said, thinking, Clever. Clever and cruel. Tens of thousands had fled the fighting for the supposed safety of King's Landing. He had seen them on the kingsroad, troupes of mothers and children and anxious fathers who had gazed on his horses and wagons with covetous eyes. Once they reached the city they would doubtless pay over all they had to put those high comforting walls between them and the war… *(ACOK Tyrion I)*

Petyr's tax on poor and desperate refugees is both (a) de facto legalized piracy, leveraging their fear of violence to extract coin they can't afford to give up, and (b) a surely unpopular ""edict"". Thus it neatly prefigures Handsome Harmund issuing an unpopular edict that outlawed the legalized piracy of reaving, leading to the Shrike and ""other priests"" of his kind overthrowing him and installing Hagon, who quickly restored the familiar regime of legalized piracy.

Note that the Shrike et al. ""blamed"" Harmund's ""Lannister mother"" — ""the Lannister 'whore',"" they called her — both for ""influenc[ing]"" his ""edicts"" and ""for turning her husband and sons away from the true god"" and toward ""demon-worship"". And recall that the shrike cut out Harmund's tongue, then cut off his nose ""so 'all men might see him for the monster he is.'""

'Naturally' *all* those motifs prove immanent in subsequent events in King's Landing, and hence recursive, as GRRM's fake histories almost *entirely* are, by design. To wit…

####The Neo-Shrikes
The groundwork of discontent having been laid by Petyr's onerous entry tax, Shrike-esque street preachers blossom in King's Landing.
>[Varys:] We also have a sudden plague of holy men. The comet has brought forth all manner of queer priests, preachers, and prophets, it would seem. They… foretell doom and destruction to anyone who stops to listen."" … ""They are spreading fear, my lord."" *(ACOK Tyrion II)*

The ""sudden plague"" of inflammatory street preachers is, of course, very possibly the doing of Littlefinger, or at least surreptitiously supported by him. Indeed, when we get a long look at such a ""preacher"", he mentions the Littlefinger-spawned rumor that Selyse fucked Patchface, suggesting he's a tool of Littlefinger (whether he knows it or not).

More pertinently to the main point here, the preacher also casts blame at both the Lannisters and the Faith, *exactly as the Shrike and his ilk did:*
>[A] sizable crowd had gathered beneath the leather awnings to listen to the rantings of a prophet. A robe of undyed wool belted with a hempen rope marked him for one of the begging brothers.

>**""Corruption!""** the man **cried shrilly [like a shrink!]**. ""There is the warning! Behold the Father's scourge!"" He pointed at the fuzzy red wound in the sky. From this vantage, the distant castle on Aegon's High Hill was directly behind him, with the comet hanging forebodingly over its towers. A clever choice of stage, Tyrion reflected. ""We have become swollen, bloated, foul. **Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon. Highborn ladies fornicate with fools and give birth to monsters! Even the High Septon has forgotten the gods!** He bathes in scented waters and grows fat on lark and lamprey while his people starve! Pride comes before prayer, maggots rule our castles, and gold is all . . . but no more! The Rotten Summer is at an end, and the **Whoremonger** King is brought low! When the boar did open him, a great stench rose to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly, hissing and biting!"" He jabbed his bony finger back at comet and castle. ""There comes the Harbinger! Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine of righteousness, or **you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!**""

>**""Fire!"" other voices echoed**, but the hoots of derision almost drowned them out. Tyrion took solace from that. He gave the command to continue, and the litter rocked **like a ship on a rough sea [see: the ironborn]** as the Burned Men cleared a path. Twisted little monkey demon indeed. The wretch did have a point about the High Septon, to be sure. What was it that Moon Boy had said of him the other day? A pious man who worships the Seven so fervently that he eats a meal for each of them whenever he sits to table. The memory of the fool's jape made Tyrion smile. *(ACOK Tyrion V)*

Summing up, the prophet attacks not just Joffrey's own ""Lannister mother"" a la the Shrike but his Lannister uncle Tyrion, a soon-to-noseless (like Handsome Harmund) ""monkey demon"" who he blames for playing the ""pipes"" to which Joffrey ""capers"", much as Harmund's mother was ""blamed"" for ""influenc[ing]"" him, ""for turning [him] away from the true god"" to ""demon-worship"". He also castigates the High Septon for his degeneracy and calls for a cleansing ""fire"", prefiguring the Shrike denouncing the septons, bringing about their expulsion, and instigating the burning of the septs.

Note that the preacher ironically gestures towards the guy the people *should* be pissed at when he decries ""Corruption!"" and ""the Whoremonger King"": the *actual* king of whoremongers, Littlefinger, who is almost certainly helming a massive empire of graft built on ""corruption"", bilking the crown dry, and levying nasty taxes on desperate and poor people. But Petyr isn't mentioned, as the prophet seems ""only"" to be priming the population to hate the High Septon (who likely knows ""too much"" about Petyr's chicanery and who irritated Petyr during recent negotiations per *AGOT Eddard IV*) and the Lannisters — especially Petyr's nemesis Tyrion — just as the Shrike and his kind stoked the Iron Islanders against Handsome Harmund.

####The Streets Blame The Lannisters
And indeed, this focus on the Lannisters and specifically on Tyrion seems to penetrate the populace of King's Landing, given the assessment of ""the city"" delivered by Jacelyn Bywater (called ""Ironhand"", a la Hardhand Hoare!) later in *ACOK,* which puts it on the precipice of a *very* Shrike-esque rebellion:
>""We held the city today, my lord, but I make no promises for the morrow. The kettle is close to boiling. … There's open talk of treason…."" … ""There is small love for the Lannisters in King's Landing. Many still remember how your lord father sacked the city, when Aerys opened the gates to him. **They whisper that the gods are punishing us for the sins of your House**—for your brother's murder of King Aerys, for the butchery of Rhaegar's children, for the execution of Eddard Stark and the savagery of Joffrey's justice. Some talk openly of how much better things were when Robert was king, and hint that times would be better again with Stannis on the throne.…""

""We are happy that 30 years after the establishment of diplomatic relations, marking the unprecedented deepening of bilateral cooperation in recent years, Luxembourg is an ambassador (non-resident) accredited to Armenia. In this regard, we believe that the next logical step will be the opening of the main consulate of Luxembourg in Armenia, which will also cover Georgia and Iran. I would like to inform you that the Armenian government is discussing the issue of opening a consulate in Luxembourg,"" said the Speaker of the National Assembly.""

""At the meeting, the challenges related to the Republic of Armenia and the people of Nagorno-Karabakh were discussed, particularly the problems related to the situation created as a result of the crisis in the Lachine Corridor.""

""At the end of the meeting, the Speaker of the RA National Assembly emphasized that our country continues to adhere to the agenda of achieving peace and expects the support of international partners, including Luxembourg, in this regard.""

I just want to point out, per your suggestion to have a government run tow company. It sounds nice in theory but in my humble opinion, the government in general, and especially in Oregon, and even more so in Portland, fucking sucks at doing things. And there are numerous examples of privately operated industries which have a high opportunity for abuse that we have been able to regulate into submission / drastically reduce rampant corruption like what you describe in the towing industry in Portland. For example, the industry I am in, public accounting. Sure you’ve got the occasional Enron or SBF or Madoff situation. But by in large the PCAOB / AICPA and NASBA have been able to keep things running fairly smoothly. For towing, I think we should do a similar thing for the tow truck industry in Oregon. Have the state establish a nonprofit corporation to oversee the towing industry. They do routine audits of towing practices for all tow companies within the state and impose heavy fines and even revoke tow truck licenses of offenders. Tow companies and drivers are required to pay for and maintain licenses and take a certain amount of educational instruction hours each renewal period. The fees from the licenses and the educational courses (paid by the tow companies) fund the nonprofit. If you are caught operating a tow truck without a license. Boom. Jail and permanent revocation of license. Certain types of convicted felons would be barred from ever obtaining a license to begin with. From what you describe, towing is a very lucrative industry. Fine. That means there’s room in the profit margin to cover the fees for licensing and education of drivers. I’m fine paying the damn tow fee if I truly was in the wrong and if the company is operating totally above board by a prescribed set of fair and regulated rules. Non predatory. Because truly, you do want to be able to call and have a car towed if some jerk blocks your driveway or something, without having to wait for a damn government tow truck that probably will never come. That could end up being a whole other kind of Wild West.",kailuapaddler69,2023-01-25,Ireland

The state could also require that all tow truck drivers become professionally licensed and trained- ensuring that all vehicles that come into their possession are properly seized with items identification and possession. 

I agree with you that the city needs to no longer contract with corrupt individuals and businesses, this creates an issue of liability- I am surprised there isn’t a class action lawsuit against the city for negligent towing practices.

Otherwise I guess the DOJ start busting down doors with RICO charges- to make this extra spicy they charge all previous sitting commissioners and department heads for their role organizational role for conspiracy.",TimeGod42069,2023-01-25,Ireland

This is probably the best post I've ever seen on reddit.

I like the NRSV to supplement the KJV. The NRSV is used by most Bible scholars, from what I understand. The NRSV uses the best manuscripts available and is much better translated. It's free online. [https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-Revised-Standard-Version-Updated-Edition-NRSVue-Bible#booklist](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-Revised-Standard-Version-Updated-Edition-NRSVue-Bible#booklist)

I love the beautiful language of the KJV. In most cases the translation is fine. But I also want to be able to consult the best translation available, in the NRSV.

I especially love reading Paul's letters in the NRSV. It's so much clearer.

BYU Bible scholar Thomas Wayment said the KJV book of Romans is basically useless for LDS - the translation has got such a Protestant spin.

Regarding the KJV, the Book of Mormon says people will stumble because of the Bible. I really think this is partly referring to the KJV. I really hope the church moves on and adopts something better.

When my kids were young I was excited to show them the church Bible videos. I was shocked to find that they didn't understand the language, which was taken from the KJV. Myself, I understand the KJV, but I and the church have failed my kids, it appears. I know a lot of people nowdays also stumble with the Book of Mormon language, which is KJV-based.

This problem with understanding the KJV language can be fixed by studying and reading a lot, but I know younger people these days don't read as much as I did when I was young. It helps me, too, that I have a degree in literature.",tesuji42,2023-01-01,Ireland

Just want to give my two cents about the NIV. I think it is the most popular translation because it is the easiest to read version that's still true to the original text, not one of the paraphrased versions like The Message. It's worth being familiar with, because it's the one that the average Christian is most likely to quote. 

And you're right, it's definitely biased. But so is the ESV, which Joshua Sears points out (in the article you linked) specifically mentions our church in the appendix as an example of a Cult to be scared of. 

I'd still read either translation, but I think it's important to recognize that no single translation is perfect, and comparing multiple is your best bet of getting a deeper understanding of any individual passage.",FaradaySaint,2023-01-01,Ireland

Here's why.,"I usually use four different versions. KJV, NRSV, CEB, and The Message. I have a couple of other translations, but these are the ones I use the most.

The Message sometimes gets poo-poo'ed on, but I still like it. When I took a class on Leviticus, it was the version that kept me sane. It has some clunkers of paraphrasing (Lord's Prayer), but sometimes you get something that just catches you off-guard- like this bit from

John 1:14:

**The Word became flesh and blood,**

**and moved into the neighborhood.**

We saw the glory with our own eyes,

the one-of-a-kind glory,

like Father, like Son,

Generous inside and out,

true from start to finish.

I'll use The Message just for devotional reading, but for study I'll use the NRSV with the CEB along with the KJV to compare. I do have the Oxford Study Bible also, but I can only keep so many books open on my desk! I do read slowly- like for Romans I might take a month to go through it.

Here is a sample of the four versions of Romans 1:1-4

**CEB**

1 From Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for God’s good news. 2-3 God promised this good news about his Son ahead of time through his prophets in the holy scriptures. His Son was descended from David. 4 He was publicly identified as God’s Son with power through his resurrection from the dead, which was based on the Spirit of holiness. This Son is Jesus Christ our Lord.

**KJV**

1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, 2 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) 3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; 4 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:

**NRSV**

1 Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, 2 which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures, 3 the gospel concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh 4 and was declared to be Son of God with power according to the spirit\[a\] of holiness by resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,

**The Message** (1-7 just because this is a paraphrase)

1 I, Paul, am a devoted slave of Jesus Christ on assignment, authorized as an apostle to proclaim God’s words and acts. I write this letter to all the believers in Rome, God’s friends.

2-7 The sacred writings contain preliminary reports by the prophets on God’s Son. His descent from David roots him in history; his unique identity as Son of God was shown by the Spirit when Jesus was raised from the dead, setting him apart as the Messiah, our Master. Through him we received both the generous gift of his life and the urgent task of passing it on to others who receive it by entering into obedient trust in Jesus. You are who you are through this gift and call of Jesus Christ! And I greet you now with all the generosity of God our Father and our Master Jesus, the Messiah.",Kriocxjo,2023-01-01,Ireland

Here's why.,"I realize few people will see this one, but I am highly recommending everyone add the David Bentley Hart translation of the New Testament. He is an Eastern Orthodox scholar currently at Notre Dame. I was initially intrigued because DBH is a universalist and I have found many of his essays to ring true with LDS theology, and after reading the intro, I was sold. This is a large block of text, but go ahead and read this to see how he accords with Joseph Smith's account of ""plain and precious things"" being lost.


>  But the prospect of writing a version that would be by my lights as scrupulously faithful as I could make it, that would not merely reiterate conventional readings of the text, and that would allow me to call attention to features of the Greek original usually invisible in English versions proved irresistible. After all, most modern readers are separated from the New Testament not only by those obvious differences in language, culture, and intellectual formation that put them at an immense historical remove from the authors, but also to a considerable degree by the doctrinal expectations that have shaped the decisions of translators for centuries. The relation between Christian theology and scriptural translation has a long and complicated history; theology has not only influenced translation, but particular translations have had enormous consequences for the development of theology (it would be almost impossible, for instance, to exaggerate how consequential the Latin Vulgate’s inept rendering of a single verse, Romans 5:12, proved for the development of the Western Christian understanding of original sin). In the end even the most conscientious translations tend, at certain crucial junctures, to use language determined as much by theological and dogmatic tradition as by the “plain” meaning of the words on the page. And in some extreme cases doctrinal or theological or moral ideologies drive translators to distort the text to a discreditable degree. Certain popular translations, like The New International Version and The English Standard Version, are notorious examples of this. These may represent the honest zeal of devout translators to communicate what they imagine to be the “correct” theology of scripture, but the preposterous liberties taken to accomplish this end often verge on a kind of pious fraudulence. Moreover, even where ideology does not intrude quite so violently on the work of translation, a kind of inertia has come to hold sway, from generation to generation, over the making of new versions: Where difficult words or syntactical uncertainties or grammatical obscurities appear in the Greek, the solutions favored by earlier translators are generally carried over by their successors, even where there may be more plausible or more interesting alternatives. At the last, generation upon generation, those who cannot read the original Greek are deprived of any way to see in the text of scripture a vast number of those verbal connections, conceptual ambiguities, and semantic oddities that are, in a very real sense, inseparable from its essence.",byukid_,2023-01-02,Ireland

They quickly launched into a lackluster recitation of the restoration lesson. I almost laughed out loud when they got to the Great Apostasy section and described it thus: ""After Jesus died, everyone pretty much did whatever they wanted, which is why there are so many different churches today.""

To strategically choose those two quotes from Joseph and Brigham and to ignore the very words that Joseph puts into the mouth of Christ in the 1838 First Vision:

>the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an **abomination** in his sight; **that those professors were all corrupt**; that: “they draw near to me with their lips, but **their hearts are far from me**, **they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof**.” He again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time.

Allow me to add a relevant quote from Thomas Paine's Age of Reason:

>A religion thus interlarded with quibble, subterfuge, and pun, has a tendency to instruct its professors in the practice of these arts. They acquire the habit without being aware of the cause.

We had an investigator that did his homework and read the First Vision carefully (from JS-H in the PoGP). He pointed out this part to us:

""I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right... and which I should join. I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that: “they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.” He again forbade me to join with any of them;"" (JS-H, 18-20)

He then asked us if we knew what the words ""wrong"", ""abomination"", and ""corrupt"" mean and what they imply. I was speechless. He concluded by saying something to the effect of ""Sorry boys, but I just don't believe God said this.""

Though I think the reduced emphasis on the Great Apostasy is more of an attempt to play nice with the neighbors now that religious sects are circling the wagons.

I told them that there was a complete restoration of the original church Jesus organized when he was here and that there had been a total and complete apostasy from said church. I remembered the flannel board illustration mentioned by one of the callers.  I remember well featuring Ephesians 4 about the organization, and we made a big deal of telling people that we have the same thing in the church today. See, we have apostles and prophets for the foundation of our church just like the one Jesus set up and members called Saints as in Ephesians 2 as I recall. This is what we told them. Unfortunately the ones we have now do not militate against being tossed by every wind of doctrine as they were claimed to have done in Ephesians 4. They are apostles in name only. Me and the others also inveighed against religious leaders who were not led by god but instead got his will through committees. I really believed this stuff and memorized all the scriptures along with their approved interpretations. I also dispensed lots of useful information about the origin of the Indians and was completely clueless about the true nature of polygamy. That caller said it well. It is not the same church that he was describing. 

When Holland and Cook were on their missions, they told people the same things that I did. Of course the first presidency did not serve missions so they might not be so bothered with all this, but I would think that it should bother Holland and Cook very much.",tiglathpilezar,2023-02-02,Ireland

They are:  
\- Native level English (IELTS band 9.0 for speaking and 8.0 for reading, writing and listening).  
\- A bachelor's degree and a 'recognised' teaching certificate like CELTA. Some other qualifications like BA/ MA in a TEFL related subject are also accepted too.  
\- Three years' of full-time adult (aged 16+) teaching experience. Full-time is considered 14+ hours per week. This can be part-time (e.g. 7 hours over six years), but has to be verifiable and from a legitimate school. This experience must be post recognised TEFL qualification.

Do you meet these minimum requirements? There is no wiggle room as far as I am aware. 

In Thailand, only IDP and the British Council examine. That limits your options. IDP shut applications a few weeks ago and the BC isn't advertising. I think there is your answer for the short-term.

I hope you're making some time for the things you enjoy today. In this post we return to Tens and Atxika in The Gardens of Deathworlders: A Blooming Love. Now, for that first section, I want you imagine you're on the phone with your grandma who you haven't called in about 6 months. That's roughly position Tens is in and he's paying for it.  


For Tylon, the AI Captain of The Hammer, Atxika specifically hired him because his clearances are so high that he is supposed to be able to access any and all classified information he needs in order to make his tactical and strategic assessments. Running into a situation where he isn't able get information he needs is unheard of for him and he is genuinely kinda pissed about that.  


In Wednesday's post, it's going to be more of the main The Gardens of Deathworlders storyline, ~~even though that last entry didn't seem to do so well~~. There's one more chapter of exposition/background that I have half way typed out, then the main plotline will kick off with the Sol System cold war that's going on. I hope those of who are reading these stories are enjoying them so far and, as always, I welcome any and all feedback!",micktalian,2023-02-11,Ireland

Teaching Council AND Requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/10zto34/the_gardens_of_deathworlders_a_blooming_love_part/,The Gardens of Deathworlders: A Blooming Love (Part 4),"I wonder how the different humans compare to one another, like in terms of the rating of their worlds and how their strengths compare against each other. Do the rest of the humans have augmentations besides things like prosthetics, (I imagine they would). Would one side be stronger or faster than the other, or would they be around equal.

Or even if the other humans went further in terms of upgrading themselves than the Nishnabe did, (I honestly believe we/they would totally go further with it then them). But to their natural bodies and DNA, and not just replacing parts with robotic ones. Or if they are roughly the same but some things being slightly different or more specialized than the other because of different wants/needs.

Especially as the rest of the humans were/are still fighting against each other the whole time after colonizing other planets. I feel like they would have boosted themselves up to near the limit their natural bodies could support, or found a way past that and mad themselves able to continuously improve overtime and/or multiple generations without drastically altering their physiology or turning completely into essentially cyborgs. The other humans would probably be even better at fighting and waging war considering they've been fighting each other way more than the Nishnabe, with them being separated from everyone else. 

Just some rambling thoughts I had to get out my head, you don't have to pay them any mind. Looking forward to continuing to see the story continue to progress and improve, and for you to do the same as an author. But overall really enjoying the story so far, waiting patiently for the next additions.

Do you mean Neighborhood Associations? HOA's are private, and hyper-NIMBY, and don't cover all of town - plenty of areas do not have them. NA's are sort of public groups that actually get money from the city to alert the neighbors that there might be a 4 plex or apartments being built near them (with some exceptions - there are some cool people in a few of them), and cover all of the city. One of our YIMBY members caught one of them spreading some fairly blatant misinformation on Nextdoor recently.

Your commentary is probably the best part!

I to am ashamed of the sheet amount of vitriol pointed at our houseless neighbors. Their lives aren't a cakewalk, by any stretch of the imagination. It's a cold, hungry, lonely, painful life that is only exasperated by the judgment and bias of individuals working from a place of ignorance around the issue.

Let's be clear. I don't blame people for feeling unsafe and uncomfortable around the houseless community. The narrative around ""drifters"" has always been that of fear.
""They'll do horrible things to you and yours"".
""They just want to take.""
'They are dangerous""

Get to know someone that has been perpetually houseless. They're often sad, scared and lonely. Their life is full of strife. Many, right from the beginning. Raised in and around addiction, abuse, abandonment and neglect. The hand they were dealt was difficult from the start. They feel alienated and unwelcome everywhere they go. 

These are human beings. Most don't want to be houseless. But the longer you are. The harder it gets to be free from it. It's a physical, emotional, spiritual and psychological black hole. 

So during this Holiday Season, do something. 
Bend isn't short on nonprofits. Good ones that care and provide sustenance and direction. 

Please, if you're reading this and you find yourself arguing. Just take a beat. Is spewing hatred and vitriol going to help? If it did. Trust me when I say, if it actually did.

Granted, it's easy to be unfair to Kor Phaeron since he's such a piece of trash.

Kor Phaeron wasn't throwing a fit because Lorgar dared know the words ahead of schedule. He threw a fit because Lorgar just quoted the book back at him word for word, and he *genuinely* hates people who don't think about what they preach. (Unless of course it serves his interest, but you can add that to anything with Kor Phaeron.)

It's one of the few things he actually teaches Lorgar, who inherits his dislike of people that just quote without trying to understand. It's part of the reason why Lorgar hates the Imperial Cult so much when he discovers its existence after turning traitor; they have belief, but no backing for it.

It's also why Lorgar is one of very few people in the setting who upon discovering Chaos made sure to learn everything he could about it, both its attraction and the ugliness of it.",Holoklerian,2022-12-28,Ireland

* Ingethel shows demon possessed Argel Tal dying to Sanguinius before the eternity gate 

* Lorgar, trusting Ingethel’s future sight, asks his fate in the upcoming war. Ingethel says it cannot be certain, and there are multiple places he could die, however  “If he ever drew a weapon against his brother Corax, **in a battle he could never win**, than he would almost certainly die”. Emphasis mine. The phrasing implies this would be during the heresy, but even if the prophecy still applies today, it’s still too specific to be a done deal.  

* Lorgar has a vision of the fall of Prospero, 40 years before it ever happened. He tries to warn Magnus, who assumes he’s an illusion or something and banishes him.  

* *Kairos goddamn fateweaver* personally gives him a prediction: 

 * He can choose between personal glory or divine destiny. If he fight Guilliman at Calth, he’ll kill him, finally gain respect from his brothers, but the heresy will fail. If he ignores Guilliman and lets him live, the heresy will have a much greater chance of succeeding. 
 He then explains that *both* of his heads were telling the truth for that one. I’m pretty sure this is the only time in the lore this has ever happened. 

* Lorgar then fights, and defeats, bloodthirster and guardian of the skull throne An’ggrath the Unbound

* Lorgar comes to the conclusion that the chaos gods desire a symbiosis with humanity, as they need mortals to have a foothold into realspace.

Probably because they originate in two different covenants: Circumcision started with Abraham and was carried on in the Mosaic laws. So, that is purely Jewish.

This is why there are no Jews (by the letter) or Greeks or Gentiles in Christ but we are all made one by His Spirit.

Keep in mind that this was said because gentile converts to Christianity convened in the synagogues with the Jews(unless, like in some cases in the book of Acts, a permanent rift arose between the two groups in a particular city). If the gentile would not live by these core things, a conscientious Jew would make sure to ostracize them out from their synagogue. Even Timothy was circumcised for this same reason(to not cause needless offense unto the Jews), and by Paul no less.

Plus, let's keep in mind that Paul is the one who says that ""Circumcision doesn't matter, or uncircumcision, but the keeping of God's COMMANDMENTS is what matters.""(1. Cor. 7:19) Thus, the Jerusalem council in Acts 15 isn't a total abolishment of the eternal law of Ten Commandments either, but rather a showcase of what is necessary for the Jew and the Gentile to associate harmoniously together so that the gospel of Jesus Christ wouldn't be brought into disrepute(by the actions of some of the gentile believers).",MiddlewaysOfTruth-2,2021-09-20,Ireland

Teaching Council AND Requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bible/comments/prqjq3/did_the_jerusalem_council_in_acts_15_get_things/,Did the Jerusalem council in Acts 15 get things half right?,"Acts 15 begins with men from Judea teaching that Gentiles need to be “circumcised according to the custom of Moses.” (vs 1) In verse 5 we learn these men were believers, Jewish Jesus followers who “belonged to the party of the Pharisees”. They believed that Gentiles must follow Jewish ancestral markers of the Old Covenant. 


Verse 6: “The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter. 7 And after there had been **much debate**” then Peter spoke. Then Barnabus and Paul spoke (vs 12) and after they finished then **James** makes the final judgment on the matter, “Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God …”


Using Hebrew prophets/scripture as support, James rightly points out that Gentiles are sons of Noah, not Abraham, and therefore he rightly only holds them to the Noahide laws. 


> Was the finding of the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 a partially correct answer? 


No. 


> Were they still in process of figuring out how to live in God's kingdom under Jesus? 


Yes. 


1\. God founded the new covenant within the covenant system that God had previously established within Israel/Judaism.


2\. Jesus left: [apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers so that the body of Christ may be built up](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4%3A11-12&version=NIV). Jesus commissioned *his disciples* to “make disciples of all nations” (aka [the Great Commission](https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A16-20&version=ESV).) Jesus intent was that his [apostles](https://biblehub.com/greek/652.htm) (Greek, *apostolos*, a messenger, one sent on a mission) build an [ekklesia](https://biblehub.com/greek/1577.htm) (a people “called out to assemble”) from all nations to be the mystical body of believers called out from the world and into His eternal kingdom. 


Paul corroborates that the gospel [is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek (Gentile).](https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201:15-17&version=ESV) This harmonizes the Old and New Testament. 


The Jesus followers weren’t called [Christians until a year after Paul’s conversion.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+11%3A19-30&version=ESV)


The Church is [whoever confesses that the son of man (Jesus manifested in the flesh is the Son of the living God. God abides in them, and they in God. So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John+4:14-16&version=ESV)


Based on Jesus’ words, [“I am the way, and the truth and the life … John 14:6](https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6&version=ESV), the earliest Jesus followers were known as [the Way](https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+9%3A2%3B+19%3A9%2C+23%3B+22%3A4%3B+24%3A14%2C+22&version=ESV) 


Convinced Jesus was the Jewish Messiah who founded a new covenant with the covenant system, the early Jesus followers continued to function as a reform sect within Judaism. There was religious and cultural diversity among first-century Jews in the ancient Near East. Under the umbrella of Judaism were: Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, Zealots – and like these *the Way* was just another expression of Judaism. They continued to follow ancestral Jewish markers: go to synagogue, follow Mosaic Law and Temple traditions; they observed the Jewish holy days, practice circumcision and followed kosher dietary laws. Keeping the Saturday Sabbath, *the Way* met with each other in each other’s homes on Sunday aka the Lord’s Day.


The early Jesus followers would look and operate much like what we’d today consider Messianic Judaism. James assumed leadership of this Jerusalem community and the apostles/leaders functioned as a group of presbyters who acted somewhat like the Judean presbyter elders of the Jewish synagogues. 


Due to the success of the Great Commission and influx of Gentile proselytes this relationship was somewhat contentious. The 50 AD Jerusalem Council was the beginning of the separation of Christianity from Judaism. It would be pretty much finalized after Rome ransacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple in 70 AD. 


At this point we see the Gentile Church move to the outer Gentile areas and strongholds to start evolving into a more Gentile religion.

That gives us some context to understand their decision more clearly.  


There was a food problem in Antioch. Galatians 2:11-14. Peter used to eat Gentile food with the Gentiles, but then when legalistic Jews showed up, he separated himself. It was really a race/culture problem, but it expressed itself in Peter and 'even Barnabas' being caught up in hypocrisy of saying they accept Gentiles but then only eating kosher, Jewish food when put to the test.  It's particular scandalous when we recall it was Peter, himself, in Acts 9 who first received the revelation about the Gentile Inclusion and it was via a repeated vision of non-kosher food and a voice thundering from heaven 'do not call unclean what I have made clean'.   


The reality is Jews had a problem with non-kosher foods. Even if they intellectually understood that 'there is no longer greek nor jew' when the pork chop lands on the plate, they'd balk, they'd been programmed for a disgust reflex. So the way I read that last part of the CoJ is an accomodation for the Jews, asking the Gentiles to try to avoid food that their Jewish brothers would find particularly abhorrent.  Did that need to be codified in the CoJ letter for all mankind? Probably not, and it's addressed, as others have pointed out, in I Cor. and Romans.   


I find it helpful to acknowledge that the Apostles didn't always get it right. I'm not discounting  apostolic authority or biblical inspiration, but it's very healthy to ask questions and look at which early church practices were repeated (and thereby can be considered normative) and which ones were not. The food instructions were not universally practiced, it seems. Just like having all things in common was a singularly early-Jerusalem-church thing (with disastrous consequences) and not repeated in other NT churches. They were human, and while they had the Holy Spirit - they dragged their feet and took mistakes and were not perfect. Acts 16:7 is my favorite example of this.",nightfly13,2021-09-20,Ireland

I absolutely hear you and good for you for reaching out to a community who can support.

It sucks. I think we’ve all felt betrayed and very, very angry, before being able to let the shock ride over. This is an important step so go ahead and feel it.   


Right now it’s gonna womp. The next few weeks will probably also womp. That’s okay too.

I highly recommend getting a good neutral therapist to talk to (Foresight has virtual counselors). We’ve been pretty messed up with the worldview the church gave us.   


i just talked with my own therapist this morning, and mentioned I have a lot of regret of teaching other people these same things. Their response, which was a lot more direct than their usual style, was, “Judging your past self brings negative value. Nothing helpful comes of it. \*Give your younger self kindness and patience, knowing you did the best you could with what you knew at the time.\*”

In the meantime, breathe, go for a walk outside in some greenery, exercise, and keep good sleep patterns. Take care of yourself. It’ll take time but you will process it, and you will feel better. (Better than ever, usually!) The freedom and release is amazing.

Shelf broke last night. devastated/lost.,"Your experience resonated very strongly with me and I am going to selfishly make this about me for a moment as I tell you: you are far from alone. I say it is selfish because it's what I need, and maybe through the resonance of my feelings and your experience I can cathrtically fulfill my own need. 

I officially left the church years ago, but the decades of trying to reconcile what I was raised with and the reality that was constantly and abrasively presented with left me emotionally and spiritually broken, exhausted,  and extremely angry. 

As you say, I don't think I will live long enough to fully deprogram myself or find true solace for my soul.  

I am not an angry person. Despite all of the horrible things in this world, there is much in life to love and I do my best to work through the psychological and emotional mine field that is still very much a part of my life/psyche, but revelations of what the church is and continues to do are so often earth-shatteringly grotesque to me.

After my world fell apart I was a mess for a while. But as a began to see daylight, a little at a time, my crooked road became straighter. 

Then my husband and I dealt with an impossible situation at our nonprofit Christian employer of many years by leaving it, moving to our next jobs in the secular workforce, and then slowly unwinding the ball that had been our faith, our work, and our identities. 

Our road is now straight. And it was frightening along the way, but there are many gifts that outweigh the scariness of it all. When you are afraid, look for the gift that comes with the fear.

One suffered in the church because of Mormon doctrine, policies, and practices.

At some point, the needless suffering causes a person to break, then enter the metaphorical “dark night of the soul.”  Everything is questioned, one’s entire world view needs reconstructing.  This process is work, painful, yet it is growth!!  One leaves the “boat“ and enters a season of darkness, loneliness, and pain as one rebuilds one’s worldview.  However this is temporary.

The person eventually reconstruct one’s world view in a manner congruent with truth, and their own values.  It is at this point where one finds meaningful peace, better happiness, and significantly more joy far far beyond the capabilities of Mormonism.

You'll be okay. You might not feel okay for a while, but you'll be okay.

I recommend therapy and studying philosophy. Epistemology is good - the study of/theory of knowledge and how we can weigh what's real and what's imagined or simply not provable.  Read. Think. Allow for anger and hurt. There's bound to be a lot of both.  Write, if you can and want to. It can be an outlet and can help marshal your thoughts, share that with your wife if you can. 

Ask questions of yourself and others.  Read some essays or works from great thinkers.  Read some Aquinas, and then compare to Descartes. Analyze their conclusions and find where they went wrong.  There's a lot to learn from well reasoned thinkers, even when they're wrong or you disagree with them.

It's my belief that you can be good without god. It doesn't take god to be moral. In fact, one could argue that the ideas of repentence and absolution enable some of the most vile acts imaginable, hanging on the thread that you can simply ask for forgiveness. Or that what you do is okay because <insert random rationalization based on religion>.

A lifetime of indoctrination will time to work through. Give yourself time. Forgive yourself for being fooled. If you can, forgive your dad. He was only human, and mislead. You're only human.

Shelf broke last night. devastated/lost.,"Fortunately for me, I figured out pretty quickly that the easiest way(for me) to delete Mormonism from my life, was to make absolutely no changes in my routine... Essentially, maintaining my Mormon habits, BUT I changed the content to something equally healthy, beneficial, and of course, in no way related to the LDS church. Here are some examples.

1. Going to church for 2 hours **=** Setting aside quality time to spend outside or with your favorite hobby for 2 hours. Mine was going for a drive through the mountains. Usually alone.
2. praying every night **=** meditating about your day(what you did well and what you could improve, what you liked or didn't. what you might do the next day), listening to relaxing music, or other relaxation and meditation techniques.
3. Young men's and women's activities **=** doing something with a group of friends or family every week. For me, it was indoor soccer, basketball, hiking, ETC.

Anyway, you get the gist. We are creatures of habit. Continue your habits, but remove the toxicity. Mormons are happy because they participate in scientifically proven methods for the most amount of happiness(strong familial/friend support, frequent physical exercise and good health, meditation, spending time in nature, reading, learning, routine, ETC). You can still participate in all those things without believing in glowing letters emitting from some rocks in a hat. You can and will be happy. Losing belief in a wonderful fairytale is horrible experience. It will take time to re-identify yourself. You will occasionally feel 'lost' initially. Eventually, you will come to terms that no religion or science knows everything about the creation of our universe, planet, existence, ETC. Exploring the mysteries, theories, and discoveries in all these things was a major part of my journey. Finding the joy in that journey and new discoveries is what kept me on the up and up after I got out. Try and find the beauty in the chaos! Highly recommend /r/atheist and /r/science.

You’re a victim. We all were. Don’t blame yourself. You did the best with what you had.

I remember a quote—from who I don’t know—that says something along the lines of, “The past and future do not exist. There is only the present. Because of that, much of our suffering comes from memory and imagination.”

You need to allow yourself time to mourn for the life that you could have had, but don’t mourn for it forever. Live your life in the present and don’t imagine what-ifs because that will lead you to suffer more. I remember once thinking that the purpose of life was to test our faith and go to Mormon Heaven but now I think that the purpose of life is to simply *experience* life. I may not believe in the BoM anymore but I still believe that “men are that they might have joy.” You owe it to yourself to do and be what makes you happy.

And don’t worry about God. Maybe there’s a god, maybe there’s not, but feel free to give the Mormon God the middle finger because he just doesn’t exist.

The Fanny Alger story undid everything. If that was true, everything before that was not, and everything after it was not. The church essays, wandering pieces of poor editing, sunk in more and more as false as questions about them came to me. The CES Letter, called bitter or angry by many, I found honest and sincere, and could relate to the mental anguish of the writer.

Emotionally, it was another four months of up and down feelings and thoughts. What about the vision of the Founding Fathers? What about this, that, how do you explain each piece? Each one came apart. The rabbit hole is deep, with a lot of true history along the way.

I was ready to resign four months later. It was the holidays, though, so I waited. I wanted my resignation date to have its own unique spot. Eight months total from first awful mental shock to downloading my confirmation letter from quitmormon.

35 years of dedication to callings for music and teaching, and twice a week in the temple as I could. Just gone. Who was I now?

Shelf broke last night. devastated/lost.,"About a year ago I stumbled onto exmormon. I had been feeling like something was “off” for awhile, but didn’t look into it. Read the CES Letters and my shelf was immediately broken. 

Couldn’t get out of bed for weeks and cried constantly. There were many days I knelt on the the floor and prayed for hours begging for answers. I flew to NY (I live on the West Coast) to go to the “sacred” grove and visited all the historical sights. I put my feet in the water of the Susquehanna were JS and Oliver Cowdery baptized each other. I visited the burial site of Emma and JS first baby. I was someplace where JS has walked and touch a headstone he had touched. I went to where he supposedly found the golden plates. I stood at the top of the hill by the monument and begged god for answers. 

No answers ever came. Not from god anyway. 

A year later and it did get better. There were dark days. Let yourself feel the bad feelings, the hard feelings. It takes time. I never thought I would recover or find meaning in life. But I have. It hurts, but you will heal.

I was really uncomfortable. I mean, REALLY uncomfortable. ... I snapped. I stood up, while someone else was talking, which interrupted the conversation. I announced my resignation of my calling. ... What happens in someones private life is private.

You are a BADASS. You are a moral person, and you did the right thing. I am so impressed and so proud.

When it comes to receiving a witness, I'm also super impressed that you never thought you had one. Because what happened to me was.... I never received one either, but I invented them in my head. Such as... not receiving an answer after reading the whole BOM and then telling myself ""you already know. That IS your answer. You already know it's true."" Which was BULLSHIT otherwise I wouldn't have been trying to get an answer. And other times I felt elevated by music and gave ""the spirit"" credit for that.

I feel like you have a super strong character.  


>I discovered an entire community of thousands of people trying to cope with having left the Mormon Church and the psychology of it all.

Awwwww <3 There is so much psychology behind leaving a cult! Glad you're here.  


>I read the Gospel Topics Essays because someone on exmormon was blown away by them. I was blown away by them myself! ... All the guilt my entire life trying to live a standard that was all fantasy, all that GUILT.

Ok this is why I ALWAYS TELL inactive Mormons to study the history and know for themselves that it's false. You can't release the burdens without that. You have to know it was an abusive fucking cult that was HURTING YOU and LIED TO YOU, otherwise there are still hidden burdens of shame, repression, guilt, etc. Yes they are ""free"" of the church physically, but they aren't free at all. They need to be free of the indoctrination.   


>Last night at approx. 5pm, sitting in my back yard, alone, I finished the chapter on the Book of Abraham.

That's the only one you need LOL. It, *alone,* proves that the church is a complete fraud. Literally the only thing people need to prove that Joseph was pulling shit out of his ass. We need to focus more on this as exmos!

Then add on top of that the fact that there are a fucking hundred MORE proofs of it being a fraud, and the whole thing turns into the most ridiculous joke... this religious is a fucking JOKE. I can laugh about it now lol.  


>I had read about shelf-breaking via some accounts on reddit, but there is no way to have perspective on it until it happens to you. I didn’t. I thought it was probably drama. Its not drama.

You literally don't know it til it happens. I'm almost glad i was in a cult bc I know no one else can possibly understand what waking up from that feels like. I recommend watching *Under the Banner of Heaven* if you haven't. There is a shelf-breaking scene and I have rarely felt so seen. I'm so glad someone captured it so perfectly.   


>I was born into a cult and I didn’t even know it. I thought people in cults were dupes. Turns out Im a dupe, my dad was a dupe, my grandparents going back generations were dupes.

My dear, this is more trauma then most people face in their lives. It's A LOT. A building collapsed on you, and you'll be crawling your way out for a while. It's a beautiful sunny meadow on the other side, but it's going to hurt a bit. The first year has a lot of anxiety. What can you trust? What is life? Are my interests and morals actually mine or were they given to me by the church? (Luckily they're mostly yours! You clearly have a strong character and inner compass!) 

You need therapy. Seriously. And please find someone who is trained in high-demand religion, it makes a HUGE difference. You need someone who has been there. 

You can start with [this list](https://www.icsahome.com/support/counseling-resources) and see if anyone is doing remote sessions. Or just check as you're ""courting"" therapists and make sure they understand. Even if they've been in a hardcore evangelical religion, they will understand to a certain extent, it doesn't have to have been a cult (but that helps :)). Mormonism is 200 years into its cult history so some things are more lowkey or normal compared to the early church history, but it's still very much a cult.

In addition to therapy, I recommend learning about cults and the invention of religion *in general.* It's quite healing to realize Mormonism is just one of a hundred bizarre cults. Once you group it into that general category, it loses a lot of power! I would recommend these books:

**The Righteous Mind** by Jonathan Haidt

**Combatting Cult Mind Control** by Stephen Hassan

**Bounded Choice** by Janja Lalich

**Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind** by Yuval Noah Harari

**Sex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality** by Darrel Ray

**God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything** by Christopher Hitchens

**The God Delusion** by Richard Dawkins.

And I point this out because about two years ago it came out in my hometown that the local doctor (Mormon guy, but doctor to Mormons as well as anyone else), had his medical license revoked, resigned overnight and moved out of state due to a lawsuit of now 100+ women. Allegations of medical malpractice and sexual assault, among others, including saying to Mormon girls that ailments (including cervical cancer he failed to diagnose) were because God was punishing them for their sexual habits. Victims included friends and family and if I weren’t out of the Mormon church already, I would certainly have left as I think is the least of reactions to expect. But unfortunately in my case, doctor is still Mormon, and my parents *became better friends with him than ever before*, including allowing him to contact my sister (who had recently been a recipient of his “treatment”) for character witness-type discussions, lunches, etc.


I haven’t spoken to my parents since before the story broke because as soon as I saw the lawsuit drop I found out they did this and it put me in a very dark place.

Legend of the Free

\[Verse\]  
Once there was a small bird  
Unaware that it could fly  
And it never asked itself  
No questions such as ""Why?""  
  
\[Verse\]  
But one night it woke up  
And decided to be Free  
Out the door it flew to places  
You will never see

\[Pre-Chorus\]  
Hence, the Legend begins...  
  
\[Chorus\]  
Forever Free  
As Wind in the Sea!  
The bird's new world  
Is more than any fantasy  
  
Beyond the bars  
Of its own little world  
A million possibilities  
Unfold...  
  
\[Verse\]  
Many years gone by, but some say  
They have seen the bird  
Othеrs say the Legend's simply  
Nothing and absurd  
  
\[Verse\]  
But from timе to time  
You can hear flappings from the high  
As another bird discovers  
Freedom in the sky

At the end of the night they checked the tickets we had collected and told me I spent too much time having fun that I can’t go into the celestial kingdom. I looked right into the eyes of that youth leader and just said, “Well, if that’s where you’re going then I’d rather not be there anyway.”

The lesson that stuck isn’t that I should try harder to be more spiritual but that leaders are simply full of shit.  Not that there can’t be any good ones out there but in general they aren’t actually doing that much good.  

I’ve had some of my own meaningful moments in life and simply came to the conclusion that human spirituality is important but also unique to each individual.  Basically, the Mormon god is not god.  That is a collective idea.  I have always had a problem with how mormon-centric “the gospel” is.  As a missionary I could connect with people fine because I was genuinely interested in them but as soon as it got down to the actual baptism work I just felt like it was such a chore.  

I look back on that time with fondness and so much regret.  To use my ability to connect with people as a tool to spread the gospel.  That’s all the church wanted from me.  I hate that.  I met some really cool people and I learned a lot from these people.  I just feel like I used them.  I hate it so much.  I mean I know I was only 19 and not fully aware of what was actually happening but it doesn’t change how I look back on it.  

So now I’m at a place where I believe in the god I believe in.  Who happens to be one that doesn’t really care about us. Or rather, why should god want us to feel guilty about living a life he already knows will be absolutely riddled with mistakes?  At least I’m trying to be kind and honest with others.  Not abusing children.  Now the point is, those things don’t require god.  Stephen Fry, an absolutely lovely human being and atheist often reminds people that this world could use more love.  Similar message of the New Testament.  God is absolutely not necessary for kindness to prevail in life.  

Again I’m sorry for you to go through this.  Best of luck letting go.  Im still learning how to as well.",benthelurk,2022-08-13,Ireland

Shelf broke last night. devastated/lost.,"Welcome to freedom! The first few weeks are gonna be really hard. You're grieving a loss, a tangible one, and your life will never be the same. 

The good news? You are at the helm of your life and you're in charge now. That can be mighty terrifying for some, and exhilarating for others. Take time for your emotions, then start planning fun stuff you never thought you'd be able to do.

Take lots of moments to rest and breathe, then reach out and create a support network of people around you locally. r/exmormon is a good place to start for the specific questions you may have down the road. Sure the subreddit gets wild now and then, but the bottom line is we've all been through this process of leaving (to one degree or another) so we can pitch in with hard-eard experience. 

You remember that stupid question, ""where will you go?"" Tell 'em, ""nowhere. I'm putting down roots where me and my family are needed."" And then that's it. Dab on the haters. Be your own success story.


Now for the *unsolicited drinking advice*! 

If you haven't started drinking yet... don't. At least not while you're figuring out your new and exciting life. 

My four rules for me go like this: Don't drink when you're upset, don't drink past your limit, don't drink and drive, and definitely don't get into the habit of drinking alone (it's much more fun to be with loved ones and friends who share your happiness anyway).

These four steps have kept me and my liver out of lots of trouble, so I'm just passing the wisdom along. Drinking can be very fun when done responsibly and, unfortunately, a lot of us exmos just don't have anyone to turn to to learn how. I was fortunate that I had my older brother (who walked so I could fly) and my best friend to learn how to drink responsibly. 

That said, it isn't for everyone and that's okay. Same goes for coffee and whatever so-called vice you want to try out as you embrace your new life. 

Keep open conversations about your feelings with your closest loved ones. Don't neglect your mental health. You will need therapy. It's good for you (for everyone, really) and I 11/10 recommend getting it if you can. 

Again, congratulations on your newfound freedom. You did it! Now go live a good life.",freehorse,2022-08-12,Ireland

Shelf broke last night. devastated/lost.,"Thank you for sharing your story.  I just want to say that sometimes what really happened to ourselves and family members is that we were trying to be Christians and follow Christ but Mormonism disrupted and interfered by imposing itself as the one true way to Christ which created confusion and disorientation.   

An analogy might be trying to love and know someone but being given a set of rules about what loves means that goes in the complete opposite direction.  Like for example, to love your wife and have an eternal marriage you must take on polygamous wives, marry teenage girls (when you have teenage girls of your own), let the prophet control your marriages, etc.   To love God and seek to know him personally, you must perform repetitive rituals invented by men who have power to excommunicate and send you to hell, etc.  

I believe in the goodness of God and that he has made his influence and interventions in my life known to me.  But we are not going to see him in this world.  There will be no visions.  Lies about God communicating with us just to let us know the church is true led many of us into confusion resulting in a complete loss of belief that there can be a God outside this framework because the church turned out to be a fraud.   God not existing at all is not the only possibility when realizing the church is a fraud.   It only means we were seeking confirmation of lies so we were asking the wrong questions.   Now we are like the rest of humanity, searching for evidence of his existence from scratch and in the ordinary moments of life -- not the temple or by following formulas the church made up.

Good luck!   It will get better!",[deleted],2022-08-12,Ireland

And when you’re sick of being mad every time you hear about the church, find a way to watch/see The Book of Mormon musical for a good cathartic laugh. 

You’ll start get glimpses of relief being out and start seeing the world in a new light, some of it ugly but so much of it beautiful and AWEsome.

I understand where you're coming from. We have a lot in common. I'm also 53, also a deep thinker and somewhat sensitive, with a strong sense of right vs wrong. 


My shelf crashed about 3 years ago, and not because I was looking for problems with our former religion. I was stunned.


But unlike you, I'm alone in my journey. My wife trusts her sweet father implicitly; her large family was everything to her, and her family was **truly** centered on the cult. I've given her a few glimpses of what's down the rabbit hole, but she backed away frightened each time. When my shelf broke I was in shock. Later I felt anger and couldn't believe I could be so gullible and blind. Eventually I felt relief that there is no reason to try to live up to such impossible standards.


To me, religion is now a very personal thing. I have my own understanding of life, the universe and everything. I'm at peace with it. For now.

I have some thoughts for you, things that I wish someone had told me in the early months. They may relate to things that you’re struggling with or they may not but I hope they help-

when I first left, I was terrified of death. Then I realized, whether or not there’s an afterlife I’m going to live the same amount of time. If there is an afterlife, I’ll find out eventually and great! If not, then I’ll be dead and won’t exist anymore so I won’t know the difference. That brought me a lot of comfort.

When I first left I frantically researched many religions, scared that whichever god was real would send me to hell if I wasn’t right. After about 2 days, I sat back and thought “if whatever god that does or doesn’t exist won’t accept me if I just do the best I can and be the best me I know how to be, then is that really a god worth worshipping?”

Shelf broke last night. devastated/lost.,"I floated for a long time after my shelf broke. Didn't know what was up and what was down. I have since found my feet back on the ground. Here are some things I learned.

1) I'm still me. Even with the upbringing I had, the church not being real doesn't change who I am as a person. I did have to re-evaluate my morals and make some ethics changes (all for the better. Crazy how mean and prejudiced the church makes a person) but I think I came out better in the end.

2) The church doesn't have a monopoly on spirituality. Any revelations I had while studying while still in the church still apply to me. I learned so many things about myself while being attuned to the universe. It was my reverence and my natural spirituality that got me those revelations, not the church. 

3) I had to unlearn a lot of shame. So many things in our lives are morally neutral. Once I was able to identify those things, life got so much easier for me. 

Things are gonna be hectic for a while but you got this. Life got better and I became so much happier after leaving. You will get through this. Lots of love.",thatgurlLu,2022-08-13,Ireland

Shelf broke last night. devastated/lost.,"You got this my friend!  I absolutely enjoyed reading your story.  It is so relatable.  I too devoured the CES letter and immediately knew that I could never unsee what I had just read.  Though the entire text was potent, it was also the book of Abraham that was the biggest impact for me.  I was 46 when my shelf broke.  The embarrassment of buying into that bullshit religion for so long is palpable.  I calculated the number of “service hours” and money that the Mormon church fraudulently obtained from me and it nearly made me puke. 

For me, I had been 100% in for the entirety of my adult life.  My oldest son had major issues with bullies in his deacons quorum.  It was absolutely miserable to spend 3 days patching my family back together after every church event.  Of the 5 people that made my sons life miserable, 4 of them were “called” to be deacons quorum president (the ward had 2 deacons quorums).  Young men president did nothing to address the situation.  Escalating to the bishop was a joke.  It was the greater sin for us to not forgive than for the boys to bully…. Boys will be boys, right?  How could I possibly teach my family to respect the priesthood when it did so much damage?  This was the beginning of the end.

I read somewhere that it takes about 1 month per year of active membership in a cult to “get over it”.  So far this seems true.  My shelf broke 1 year, 4 months, and 3 days ago (Hi my name is Idrumfofun and I am a mormonoholic).  I spent about 1 week in shock and emotional.  I quickly moved to 4 or 5 months being angry.  I spent several months feeling disoriented and confused as my entire world view was laid waste.  I have slowly transitioned toward indifference with a large dose of trauma responses that come at random times.  Very slowly over time I feel like I am getting healthier.  Even with all the pain, I feel so liberated.  I am finding it much easier to live my best life today.

Put your seatbelt on my friend.  It will be a rough ride for a while…. I promise, it will get better and you will be happier.

Everyone has their own mechanisms for healing.  One of the biggest in impactors for me was taking back my power.  Here’s how it went for me.  I had the fortunate opportunity to leave Mormon Mordor in SE Idaho and relocate to the Midwest where I haven’t seen a church or an ugly ass temple yet.  The first contact that I got from the church I told them to move my records to my new location.  When they arrived, I immediately set up an appointment with the Bishop.  Someone from that godamn church was going to hear my complaints about the dishonesty of the church, accept my demand for a refund on all fraudulently obtained money, and accept my letter of resignation.  Those are the 3 tasks that I assigned to the Bishop.  It was super therapeutic to write out my resignation letter with a listing of grievances and read it to the bishop when he asked why I was resigning.  I also had the honor of standing next to my wife and children as we all took turns delivering our grievances and declarations of resignation.

I recommend watching the Leah Remini documentary on Scientology and a heavy dose of Mormon stories pod cast.  I’m not a big fan of the “response to current church event” episodes but there are tons of episodes with people telling their stories.  John has his top episodes listed and that’s a pretty good place to start.  They are long as hell but worth it.  There is also a giant series on the book of Abraham and I love the John Larson episodes.

Shelf broke last night. devastated/lost.,"It seems to me that you can't know ahead what devastation truly deconstructing your world view at this level causes, at least for some of us. I'm with you, OP, on a number of conclusions. You can now consider yourself a lazy learner, with the rest of us.

I'm a few years out from full shelf-breaking as you're describing here, of similar age but I was never much of a good Mormon (apostate, as you put it, I call it my JackMo phase). Regardless, I still fully believed that the Mormon narrative was the nature of this universe and I was just broken. Over about 25 years or so I tried to kill myself slowly, with food, alcohol, and drugs, mostly because I just continued to cram everything up on the shelf and never dealt with issues, I think. I had other things to do like earn a living, raise my kids, etc.

The journey was long, I'm still finding myself waking up every once in a while and it hits me all of the sudden that it was all crap and that I believed it for so long, but it gets slowly easier to deal with.

You seem to be a lot more mentally evolved than I was at the time my shelf broke, but I still highly recommend a good secular counselor, especially if you can find one that specializes in cult/religion recovery. I found a good one in my area at seculartherapy.org. It took me a good year of counseling to get to a place where I was happy with myself (that's still ongoing) and how I was thinking. Not even close to perfect, but better.

One thing I found particularly rewarding is no longer having to square circles that the magic thinking of religion caused me to have to accept if I wanted to accept religion itself. Now I can look at any situation and feel ok if I'm woefully mis/uninformed, in fact delighted that I get to learn something new about reality. Turns out it's pretty stark sometimes, but I always come back to this; it's better to know the truth than believe a lie.

Shelf broke last night. devastated/lost.,"Your story broke my heart and everything you’re feeling is EXACTLY what I went through a couple of years ago. My whole identity was constructed around the Mormon church, so without the Mormon church who was I really? Something that literally saved my life was that I found a non-denominational church that I attend regularly. In two years of regular attendance there, I’ve never given a penny in tithing and nobody in that church has said a word to me about it. I also have never been asked to volunteer in any capacity, but a few months ago I offered to volunteer and they were grateful for my offer and they found a spot for me. This volunteer thing is on MY terms. No meetings, no quotas, nothing. I honestly was completely lost but that church helped me replace my anger and my pain and my hatred of the Mormon church with feelings of joy and gratitude for a church who does pretty much everything in a different way versus what the Mormon church does. I read somewhere that over 75% of Mormons who leave the faith don’t ever end up going back to church in any denomination ever again and I believe it and I understand why. You spend your whole life being fed a bunch of bullshit and you just reach a point where you’re done. You don’t want to play the religion game anymore. You don’t want to be a paying customer anymore for a business that pretends to be a church. Discovering the fraud that is the Mormon church for me was like discovering a loving wife that has been having sex with lots of other men behind your back. You have no idea and you love her with your whole heart, but all your friends and neighbors know her secret except you. Then one day you realize what a lie your whole marriage to this person was. Now in some cases a man would say “yep I’m permanently done with marriage” and they go on for decades telling everyone how terrible their ex was. Their heart is full of sadness and hate. But the guy who finds love again in a real marriage with a genuine woman ends up filling himself with joy and happiness and slowly he lets go of all that animosity and anger that he held about his cheating ex wife. Soon he never talks about his ex to anyone because he’s happy and he doesn’t want to waste any more time or attention on a human being like that. This is the best analogy for how I feel about the Mormon church. The Mormon church is actually the “whore of all the earth” and all the pain these leaders at the top have caused will have to be accounted for some day. Imagine the Fathers who disowned their gay children because the Mormon church taught them to hate. Or the Mothers who kicked their daughters out of the house because of a teenage pregnancy. I still have to interact with family members at Sunday dinners and listen to their bullshit Mormon perspectives on the world in general and it makes me nauseous. Being on the outside looking in now makes me realize how complete the mental programming is that was done to me from birth and I now look at active Mormon members with pity. I feel that way because I was them a few years ago. I felt like I would go to hell if I read anything that was not approved by a random collection of white businessmen. I’m so sorry for what you’re going through right now but things get much better as time passes and one day you’ll realize that you went a full 24 hours without even thinking about the Mormon church once. That’s a truly great day indeed. Don’t focus on the fact that they stole 45 or 50 years of your life, just focus on the fact that you get the opportunity to live your own life for however many years you have left. That’s an opportunity that your own Dad never got. Our lives can now be whatever we want them to be instead of us being free business inputs that contribute to the staggering wealth of Mormon Inc.",sparrow801,2022-08-13,Ireland

Then I went through each one and tried to feel all the feelings I had during those times. At the end I realized God wasn’t helping me through the hard times, I was strong enough to do it on my own. I did that.

Most exmos, me included, spend too damn much time learning our car is not just a lemon but it is a death trap and yet we don’t leave it at the dump. We are fascinated by the layers of lies, the nearly two centuries of lies. When I read a book and 50 pages in I am saying to myself, “Gawd this is a terrible book”, I do not continue to punish myself. I just put in the trash. I don’t want it even taking shelf space. 

But for the last 11 yrs I keep reading this same damn awful time sucking book. 

Don’t do this. I want it to be a different experience for you. Focus on loving your family, being a renewed free whole person. Don’t give this scam another month of your life. Consider yourself an addict. Go clean & fresh in your thoughts. When “WTF?” Enters your mind, take your kids/dog/wife to the park. Heal. Exercise. Train your brain to smile freely. 

You do not need answers that are not there. In 2-3 yrs of actively being a new person you will be able to laugh about being in America’s cult.

But the feeling of doing everything they ask, just for the reward to be for naught can really fuck with your psyche. I hated being in ward council meetings or presidency meetings because it was very methodical and never felt the spirit there.

And I can think back to really “emotional” moments in the church, but I can also see how the music or tone or emotion from the other speaker may have wrought those emotions on me, as a way to sympathize with their story instead of it being divine.

CES Letter - Book of Abraham was definitely the final breaking point for me as well.

It has been a wild ride in the years since - I remember distinctly going thru what clearly felt like the stages of grief in the weeks after the shelf breaking. I am so glad that I had my partner to go thru it with me because it was very hard. Sounds like you do as well. Acceptance will come.

It does get better. We had to ""come out"" to immediate family to stop the ""come back to church"" talk. We completely resigned in 2018 when the church excommunicated Sam Young for advocating against policies and procedures to Protect Children helped to completely solidify that boundary.

In the years since - we have been able to support other close family and friends in their Journey out of the church. Just last night another close family member confided that their shelf is very heavy - and how the AP article hit close to home with experiences they personally had in church with abuse. They have a son on a mission and we would not have guessed they were struggling.

We too cannot imagine being in any religion - we tried. The social aspect was nice - but just could not get into it. We just try to be the best humans that we can be while living authentically as we are.

I feel for you and can say that I walked this trail too, realizing in my mid 40’s that TSCC is a sex cult and a pious fraud.  When I realized that Brigham Young stood by when JS was killed in order to keep polygamy front and center, it was apparent to me that the driving force behind the church was sex. I had to answer three questions to deconstruct my programming. 

1. Who was Joseph Smith and why did his skills, upbringing, family, and charisma enable him to found the church?  What role did his father, who was a known counterfeter and ConMan have in passing on the skills to carry on the family business? What were the sociological an economic factors that empowered him in his day?  What role did folk magic, pirates, counterfeiting and plagiarism have in preparing the charismatic leader to rock star-like fame and build a fanatical fan base?

2. Why didn’t the church die with its charismatic founder?  How did Brigham Young arrest control from the pre-ordained (JS had public named his child as his successor) successors and Emma‘s children? 

3.  Who is the church today and how do these men who have resumes consistent with fortune 500 board directors justify what is arguably today the most successful fraudulent organization in history.  How can they live with the hypocrisy to declare standards of morality and declare themselves judges of the standards of honesty when their souls are cankers of hypocrisy?  

Today the church is still a family run business. Most of the members of the 70 and the Q15 are direct descendants or married direct descendants of the product of Joseph’s 3x wives and Brigham Young‘s 5x wives. That makes it a sex cult….

Here is the full list of relationships from Michael Quinn’s incredible research. 

I never knew that Oaks was the great grand nephew of Martin Harris. The list is outright ridiculous for an organization that claims to be serving a global population.

I remember when my shelf broke pretty vividly. I had already been exposed to everything that broke your shelf, but unlike you, I had been CONVINCED that I had had MULTIPLE confirmations that the church is true. The spirit had told me so on multiple occasions. I was raised in a family very similar to yours, too. So even with all the cognitive dissonance, and everything I didn’t understand or agree with, they were just things I’d “understand after this life.” But what broke my shelf was after my trans friend took her life. She and I grew up together. She was like a brother to me growing up. I went to church the Sunday after it happened, and stayed for another hour after. Just sitting in the chapel, praying, screaming at god. I just wanted to feel peace. To know my friend was ok and happy. I felt nothing. He wasn’t there.

Its amazing that such a deep heart wrenching story is actually not uncommon.

So, here something I wish I had known at the beginning of my faith crisis:  


You have just changed WHAT you think. Changing HOW you think will take much much longer. To recondition your mind to look for truth in common sense and evidence instead of in emotions and signs will take a while, probably years.

Don't make any life altering choices while you are still reeling from this blow. You aren't ready. Baby steps are key. And remember, for a while here you are probably prime cult bait. Your brain still works like a cult members. If you stumble into a new cult, that is sufficiently different from mormonism right now, you will fit right in.

Everything the church does is there to make itself a more perverse part of your life to reduce the level of you in there and increase the level of church. The worthiness interviews are there to ensure the balance between you and and church in there stays in the church's favor.

You mentioned finding yourself again, but don't think of it as having lost yourself. Yes, you'll have to peel away the church and find the ""you"" underneath that veneer of habits and traditions. You are there; the real you is there. 

Please try to separate the ""church"" from beliefs in a higher power, or in the teachings of Christ. Those are entirely separate things, and as a convert (who was all-in & TBM for at least a decade), I can tell you TSCC in no way reflects the true teachings or beliefs of God (or a higher being) in any form or in any legitimate religion.

It also frees you to process your anger, sadness, and other feelings without feeling guilty that you're not grateful enough.

I've been out 8 years now.  If you're anything like me, certain things will always be triggering.  It's never totally gone.  However, I no longer feel guilty for being human.  My relationship with my wife is vastly better now that we're both out, which is saying something because we've been very close for all of the 14 years we've been together.  I finally feel good enough, and I feel the peace that the fraud always promised.  It genuinely does get better, and not just on the surface.  The deep pain and feeling that something is missing is gone for me, and the only thing that really gets under my skin about it anymore is the fact that I felt that way unnecessarily for so long.",_FatWhiteGuy,2022-08-13,Ireland

My testimony had been fading and I started getting curious about the Book of Abraham thing too after a roommate had mentioned it in my last few semesters of college.

I googled it and one thing led to another thing to another. Tom Phillips account of the 2nd anointing is the one that always reminds me of the tipping point for me, and it wasn't even a major shocker for me, I think that was the first time I realized I didn't believe anymore.

That led to this subreddit, which led me to reading the CES Letter. I read it late into the night and was emotionally sick the next day. I couldn't focus at work and I think I ended up going home early.

Think of a pendulum. If it swings far to one side, it will swing far the opposite direction. If it swings a little, it only goes a short distance the opposite way. For people, who were never fully indoctrinated, or who never really had big responsibility in the church, or like never paid tithing etc., when they finally let go of the church and their pendulum swings from the belief side to the truth side, it only goes so far. It’s easier for them to move on.

I completely understand how you are feeling. My shelf broke about 6-7 months ago. I cried and cried for weeks.  

I was ALL in when my husband told me he didn’t believe the church was true anymore. I panicked and didn’t know what to do. He kept telling me little controversial historical facts for the next few weeks and finally I snapped and said, “Where are you getting this information?? Quit telling me these things unless you have solid sources to go with them!”

A couple days later he gave me a google doc of all his concerns with links to church journals/documents/essays/etc. I was going to prove him wrong. Instead, It took me less than two days of reading it for my shelf to break and my eyes to open. 

I was devastated and elated at the same time. I felt confused, yet wonderfully free. I have cycled through the grief cycle many times, but it’s getting easier over time. 

My heart breaks for you. Such a beautiful and relatable post. My husband and I are still working on getting out for personal reasons. We have been shunned, gossiped-about, lied to, belittled, defriended, etc. Still trying to figure out how to tell his side of the family. Mine is already exmo and supportive. Also trying to figure out how to start over and rebuild.

now I tell people, If you don’t think you’re in a cult, just try leaving. It gets really weird really fast.

For me it felt like the core of who I was disappeared suddenly and I didn't know what the point of life was anymore. It took a while for me to find a new purpose, but the most rewarding part to me was that I got to choose what the purpose was. I didn't have to let someone else tell me what it was and why it should be that way.

It took me a while to get over the despair and anger. It's been four years since my shelf broke and I still get upset from time to time. It'll get easier, but as I'm sure you know it'll hurt like hell before it gets better.

I'm happy you have a partner who supports you as you're going through all this. I wouldn't have been able to do it without the support of my wife. I strongly suggest therapy, too. It helped me not then anything.

Shelf broke last night. devastated/lost.,"Thank you for sharing I am 55 and going through much the same thoughts, feelings, experience.  I have been 'ALL in' all of my life.  The shelf has existed for most of my life.  Things got really heavy recently and it broke.  I have been aware of the 'do not report to authorities' systemic handling of mandatable crimes that should have been reported and it is a line in the sand for me.   If a religion cannot put as its most basic tenants the shelter and care of the most innocent among us 'children' then what on earth good is it then anyway?   Also in reference to the many other things outlined in the CES Letter and other historic information I simply quote J. Rueben Clark ""If we have the truth, it cannot be harmed by investigation.  If we have NOT the truth, it ought to be harmed"".    


I am not caught on some specific piece of doctrine although I believe we could do that and find reason enough for an opt out, I am more so caught on the Psychology behind it all and the layers of manipulation that permeate ' the system' of thought.  Ie: Control of information did you know that when an idea is put forth that doesn't agree with the strict narrow narrative/system that it is dis-allowed and the person that maybe has legitimate questions is shunned.  Group shun is a cultural (CULT-ural) part of the system.  Do people know they are doing it....not as much until they may experience it from the other side.  Many have been ex-communicated for sharing with others in a public way something that didn't make sense for them and wanted to exchange information and experiences.  Similar to bearing a testimony but actually how you really feel.  True honesty.  Such as the Dr. of Psychology that shared how normal it is for someone to experience masterbation as a positive and important part of regular human sexuality and discovery.   This person said something in a public way that did not support the 'true' narrative and the narrative won.  One less anti-mormon perpetrator near the fold now all are safe from that horrible concept.  That the natural man is an enemy to God and must not touch themselves or you are demonstrating for instance that you have an addiction that only an LDS approved Clinician can help OR that you may be under the influence of SATAN.  More of the truth might be closer to you are a normal human being trying to make sense of the fact you have this overpowering urge that consumes you and you don't know your proper relationship to it and until you do you explore it.  The lds narrative/system teaches that the Natural Man is an enemy to God.

Didn't you know the Natural man is an enemy to God.  WHAT?  Why then would he create so many enemies?  Didn't he create us?   If you cannot see that control of information is profoundly important to the Church (waay more important than supporting people) then you have not considered the level of significance of not reporting children being abused to authorities.  Or maybe you have not seen that if you disagree with the narrative then you will be corrected, shunned and potentially cast out.  The art of manipulation is in play.   Are we lead astray?  To come to a moment in this short life to have a mind that can think without control of thought or outside the box of religion is a freeing concept I have NEVER really experienced until recently.  If you repeat something enough times it becomes you.   GOVERNMENTS know this and actively utilize dis-information to accomplish ill gains.  Such as occurred in world wars that have come and gone.  Maybe even now.  I cannot believe how much is put on the life after now.  Are you really serious?    What about now?  The short time we have with the people that bring us joy and happiness NOW?  I am not saying eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die BUT there is a LOT of truth to that.  Does someone know something I do not?  ACTUALLY know something I do not?  MY Mom has been gone most of my adult life and I have not heard from her and if that changes I will let you know but for me that places a major emphasis on this life NOW.    


I didn't start this rant to say all of this it just needs to be said maybe for my sake.  The part about realizing if this is not what it says it is,  then my  every thought, action, month in year out, dollar in, down to clothes that I wear and the food that I have eaten have been created by a man and not God almighty is a thought that  explodes my mind.  The Temple ceremony coming STRAIGHT from the Masonic Temple Rights and ceremony.  On the shelf for years BTW.  The fact that when things get too hot about a certain subject (1978) then there is a convenient revelation fixing them.  On the shelf for years BTW.  

I found myself relating more to the tares than the wheat many years ago and the more there is people falling into questions of the reality of the proposed LDS narrative then many in the fold use the wheat and tares concept from the General Authorities down.    If Christ did not come for the tares then what shall I do?  

I have love and gratitude in my heart for a wonderful upbringing, and mother who with all her heart taught me the narrative/system above all else.  I cannot fault her or anyone else because they were simply doing what the narrative/system told her that she/ they had to do to get closer to God.  I pray but even when I pray the repetitive throng of how I should pray comes to overshadow my expression of thought and then I wonder does God care about me saying thee or you?

I am not talking to you now because I have some great desire for sin, substances, Satan, offense that I took about an individual or individuals in the Church although that last one sure seems to work out.  Instead I need space to clear my mind and soul.  To find Peace in the things that I am free to learn of or experience.  I am resolute that this will continue to support my goal of being the best Father and Husband that I can be while here.  I may need to vent more but for someone who has held many callings and been close to the inner workings of it all I open my random thoughts to you all and end them for the moment.

The AP article has shaken me to the core, as did the CES letter, The Happiness Letter (once you understand it was written by JS to Nancy Rigdon, to try to coerce into his bed, even after she said ""NO!"" My husband of 40 yrs is very committed to his Spiritual experiences, etc. He's very angry I had my name removed from Church. We have to stay away from the subject of church. Interestingly enough, he goes to the Sacrament meeting and then comes home. He pays no tithing thus no Temple Recommend, has no calling, doesn't keep the Sabbath holy and no longer blesses his food. But, ""The Lord knows the intent of his heart!"" Great! Find comfort in that. I've gone through the stages of grief over and over again. I hope one day it will be easier. I know I've made the right decision, but it's the hardest thing I've ever done. I wanted the church to be everything I'd been taught, and taught my kids.

You are probably experiencing PTSD at this moment, so be patient and kind to yourself. Approach this with compassion for yourself. Scream and cry all you need, so you can release what you're feeling.

6 years on my family are all out and doing well. Relationships with TBM family are mostly mended. Relationships with true friends stayed in tact. Life is actually pretty good. Kids are succeeding. Wife is happy.

It gets better friend. But none of this is a race. Take a few deep breaths. Take a break from Exmormon if you need to. It is perfectly fine to simply punt on all of this for a time. My wife and We waited 1.5 years before we left just so we could process what we had experienced. It made leaving easier because once we did leave we were certain and had no regrets and little fear.

Practice self care. This will all be there tomorrow. There is no reason why you have to dwell on it 24/7. Go for a walk. Clear your head. Talk to a friend about anything BUT this. Catch your breath.

Someone had to call BS on this. But nice detail to try and gain legitimacy. Hahaha.,Crazy_Whereas_4596,2022-08-24,Ireland

Shelf broke last night. devastated/lost.,"No. It isn't all a lie. The Book of Mormon is real, it was from God, and He did establish the Church. I know this because I did receive the witness you were seeking in ways that are undeniable.

That said, the Church is off the tracks and the Child Abuse Hotline/Arizona Child Abuse scandal is really only the tip of the iceberg. The Church's Covid-19 policies, the way tithing is taught and the fact that the Church accepts tithing from very poor people (even middle-class Mormons are greatly afflicted by the Church's tithing policies), the Dick and Brenda Miles scandal (if you want to have a very, very bad day read ""A Report of Child Sexual Abuse in LDS Neighborhoods"" by Marion B. Smith) are just some of the very real problems that the Church faces. 

Have faith in God and the Lord Jesus Christ and they will help you understand that agency is real and causes great struggles but that They have all power and will overrule for the good of mankind. What has been done to the Church is **infuriating**, but I know that Help is coming.",Alternative_Annual43,2022-08-24,Ireland

Shelf broke last night. devastated/lost.,"I would very much recommend watching/reading Carl Sagan's Cosmos and other works. I find his outlook on life so comforting, as an ex-mormon atheist. I've been looking for a link to a video I watched years ago about how our brains find patterns in randomness, as a necessary evolutionary adaptation that tricked us into creating religion. It made me realize that every little ""personal revelation"" I thought I had experienced was just false patterning and confirmation bias. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find it online, but I'm pretty sure it's part of his Cosmos TV series.

I also recommend the YouTube channel Kurzgesagt, for something more modern. https://youtube.com/c/inanutshell",rfresa,2022-10-13,Ireland
