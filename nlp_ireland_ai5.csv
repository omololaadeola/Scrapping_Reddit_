Instead of buliding new classes they just add 10% seats every year to existing classes. It's hard for teachers and students in this environment.",MaintenanceSea7158,2022-09-05,Ireland
GAA AND PE OR Physical Education OR Teacher OR Sports Science,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/x6e197,Student-Teacher Ratio in Primary and Secondary Level,"Very interesting graph (yes ik its probably from the r/indianmaps or something)

It looks like kerala needs more primary school teachers, on one hand. On the other hand, states that have less than 15 student to teacher ratio may have it because they do not have enough students in their teacher. I remember one Malayalam actor turned politician talking about how there's a school in his constituency with just one student and one teacher, how the school is closed only when there is a public holiday or when the student gets sick.

Which is why i believe 20-25 is the best ratio. we can assume theres 25-30 students on average in each class and one class teacher for each class. assuming theres more teachers than classes, the average becomes around 25 for a healthy school",Minute_Juggernaut806,2022-09-05,Ireland

Why are the Clifford Bros allowed to play for a Senior Club and a Junior club in Kerry? Are GAA players allowed to do this? Seems a bit unfair.,"Because they play for a club that's in the junior championship (promoted to intermediate for 2023). Every club in Kerry is associated with  a regional/divisional side also. 

If you club is not senior then you can play for one of these divisional sides. 

Austin Stacks, for example, were the winners of the 2021 county championship, but were relegated to intermediate in 2022. This year, their players are eligible to play for the St. Brendan's board divisional side.

Effectively it's so that players from small rural parishes can get the opportunity to play at the highest level in the county without moving to a big club.",[deleted],2023-01-08,Ireland

We have the “Senior Club Championship” and the “County Championship”.

Senior club is self explanatory. It’s clubs (8) only e.g. Rahillys, Crokes etc. and a club can be relegated to the intermediate championship. The club which wins this is the Kerry representative in the all Ireland series.

The county championship is made up of divisional sides such as east Kerry, feale rangers, mid Kerry etc. and the 8 clubs in the senior club championship. The idea is that it gives players who are good enough to play senior football a chance to play at that level. For example, the east Kerry team has players like the Clifford’s from Fossa (a junior club) and other junior and intermediate club players to make up their side. The winners of this are the county champions. Divisional sides who win this can not go into the all Ireland series. However, we are a bit strange in Kerry and we decided this is a harder thing to win so if a clubs wins this they get to displace the winner of the club championship and represent Kerry in the all Ireland series instead.",CC9567,2023-01-08,Ireland

Found an article, I've been reading about etfs and moreso etns.


Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”) announced today that it will implement a 1 for 4 reverse split of its iPath® Series B S&P 500® VIX Short-Term FuturesTM ETNs (CUSIP: 06746P621) (the “ETNs”) which it intends to be effective at the open of trading on Tuesday March 7, 2023. The ETNs currently trade on the CBOE BZX Exchange (“CBOE”) under the ticker symbol “VXX”.

Barclays has the right (but no obligation) to initiate such a reverse split of the ETNs at its discretion on any business day, as described in the pricing supplement relating to the ETNs. On February 17, 2023, the closing indicative value of the ETNs was $11.702.

The record date for the reverse split of the ETNs will be effective after the close of business, New York time, on March 6, 2023. The closing indicative value of the ETNs on the record date will be multiplied by four to determine the respective reverse-split adjusted value of the ETNs. The reverse split will be effective at the open of trading on March 7, 2023, and the ETNs will begin trading on the CBOE on a reverse-split adjusted basis on such date. The reverse-split adjusted ETNs will have a new CUSIP, but will retain the same ticker symbols.

GAA AND PE OR Physical Education OR Teacher OR Sports Science,https://i.redd.it/cpqudb7qewja1.jpg,So this is how people are spreading misinformation by leaving this on bus stops,"I just had a sudden flashback to my crazy ex-roommate. She used to get piles of these papers and give them out to the clients of her home-based reflexology business. (Note: she got her reflexology credentials, such as they were, from an internet course. She never required her clients to wear masks, and after a while refused to accept vaccinated clients. I also was never quite sure if the lease allowed her to operate such a business.) More than once I actively contemplated whether she would notice if I put a little sign up saying: ""Want some misinformation? Get it here!"" 

I did quietly dump a pile of them in the recycling once. 

She was beyond any sort of logic by that point. She was twenty years older than I and half my size, and yet I reached a point where I was actively terrified of her. If you dropped the wrong word to her, it was like a switch was flipped in her brain and she went from sweet old lady to a demon spitting rage. I used to make plans for what to do if she did flip out long term.   


The Druthers papers were a step on a long journey of terror which led to her listening to podcasts by Alex Jones and ilk so loudly I could hear it in every room in the house, including the bathroom (and I kept wondering how could she, who claimed she just believed in love and everyone being happy, *not* pick up on all the subtextual homophobia, racism, and anti-Semitism and the general toxicity). I had multiple conversations with her asking her to please get some headphones, which I figured was a safe and reasonable request, which always resulted in her acting shocked it was so loud and promising to be more careful, and then nothing changing. Between the volume and the fact I can't *not* listen to background noises (probably ADHD), I ended up having to wear noise cancelling headphones all the time at home to preserve some sanity (and sometimes could still hear her podcasts through them).   


It'll be a year next month since I escaped, and given how tense and anxious I immediately got at seeing that paper,  I still have trauma to work through.

An analysis of season and playoff GAA among Vezina-winning goaltenders,"So there's been 34 years of data here and 3 have won the cup. So roughly 8.8% of the time the team with the Vezina winning goalie wins the cup.

However the average playoff teams with all things being equal has a 6.25% chance of winning the cup.

So it seems like there is a positive correlation between a goalie winning the Vezina and a team winning the Stanley cup. Which is exactly what would be expected",Stingray44,2020-12-06,Ireland

An analysis of season and playoff GAA among Vezina-winning goaltenders,"My guess....because their massive salaries don't go towards puck possession(they can be as solid as they want but if the whole game happens in their zone they're gonna end up losing) and because they can often carry a terrible team out of the good picks, like Hasek(GOAT carried a terrible team to the finals lol), Bobrovsky, Price, Miller, which leads to their teams never improving and being stuck in the bubble. 

Lundqvist for example may have had good W/Ls and even made a final(when the East was rebuilding like today's West) but outside of his first two seasons has never played with a #1C, Norris caliber dman or even a franchise winger(until Panarin, when it's too late for him). Kiprusoff was just him and Iginla, Holtby and Vasilevskiy won and Rask/Rinne had inflated careers due to their teams. Thomas did too but ended up winning so it worked out(he never got a massive superstar payday). Here in Montreal we had our entire generation of Habs hockey ruined by a superstar goalie(Bergevin not drafting an NHL player in 9 drafts also helped), we know all about the struggles of making the playoffs with a star goalie and no hope!",syn_47,2020-12-06,Ireland

An analysis of season and playoff GAA among Vezina-winning goaltenders,"Problem about looking for correlation is that the Vezina winners were often picked for reasons entirely independent from one consistent statistic.

Fuhr, for example, won the Vezina in 87-88 almost entirely because he started a then-record 75 out of 80 games; at a time where starts were usually split 40-40/50-30 between two goalies.

Brodeur's 02-03 Vezina was a bit of a ""career achievement"" award at that time. The narrative *against him* had been that he was playing behind a great defense, and then it got flipped into him getting snubbed for too long *because* he was playing behind a great defense.

Also: a lot of people voting for the Vezina used to put a ton of weight on **wins** by goalies (kinda like pitchers in baseball). Almost every Vezina winner from 86 until about the 2000's was near the top of the list for wins.",AlexNyko,2020-12-06,Ireland

He can only do so much. 

Put another way: Hasek is the greatest goalie that will ever play the game. He's the best anyone ever had or will have.  There was a year, like a lot of years for him where he led the league in save percentage.....BUT also led the league in goalie losses.  That should tell you all you need to know about why having a Vezina winning goalie, about why having even the GREATEST goalie of all time, doesn't mean you're gonna do well in the playoffs or even in the regular season.",Jerry_from_Japan,2020-12-06,Ireland

Due to my daughter having Asperger's Syndrome, she was very difficult to communicate with at the time (she has improved a whole lot since then) and my ex could not bear to take her places like hairdressers  so I would do it. 

I realised that I would have to take her to the opticians and somehow get a little girl, who was terrified of anything that required her to sit still, to take a verbal requirement eye test. 

Luckily she was into old episodes of Family Guy and there was an episode where they took the piss out of Disney churning out unwanted sequels to old classics. The episode had 'Aladdin 4 - Jaffar needs new glasses' in it and I used this as my template to help her understand that she needed to tell us which lens choice was better. 

After a long session in the opticians, and an even longer wait to get the glasses collected (I was only allowed to pick my daughter up every other weekend), I took her to get her new glasses and I will never forget the look of wonder on her face as she saw properly for the first time.

The problem is the majority of the lens is for distance seeing - driving and walking. Lately I need to see up close - for soldering - which forces me to look down my nose or over my glasses. Or remove my glasses altogether and soldering within inches of my face and eyeballs. 

I bought single vision lenses for close up work and it’s wonderful. I can see perfectly within arms length.

GAA AND PE OR Physical Education OR Teacher OR Sports Science,https://v.redd.it/52pcc6no3s5a1,I can see EVERYTHING!!!!,"For those asking. It looks like the kid has a high hyperopic Prescription and slight astigmatism. This essentially means the eye power isn't strong enough so needs glasses with a Plus lens to make up the power 

It also looks like there is a right esotropia(the right eye turns in) which the glasses will help to straighten. This is because in young kids they accommodate(lens changes shape to become more powerful) which at certain point causes the eyes to turn in.

In order to work out a prescription for young kids drops are used called Cyloplegics. These work on the ciliary body which is the part that causes the lens to change shape. As rhe kid can't accommodate. Then using a retinoscope we neutralise movement of the light to work out what the prescription is that would correct the light to focus on the correct part of rhe retina.

There is also various techniques to measure vision in young kids and most tests are objective so it is the Optometrist using their experience and not relying on the kid to answer. These include prefferntial looking(use pictures of varying sizes and see if kid looks at  them compared to a plan background)

In all it is a mix of science and art. Youngest I have personally seen is 3mths old(due to strabismus that was born with) and oldest is 112yrs old",East_Air_4756,2022-12-14,Ireland

If this was done by any FF or FG politician, it would have been condemned to the extreme by Labour Party members.

I stopped reading at this point.

Here's a contemporaneous report from a British newspaper:

[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/irish-minister-set-to-survive-scandal-1427878.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/irish-minister-set-to-survive-scandal-1427878.html)

&#x200B;

>Public anger focused on the conduct of the police officer who leaked details of the case involving Emmet Stagg, the junior environment minister, to the press when it was clear no crime was committed. Pat Cox, the deputy leader of the Progressive Democrats, called on police authorities to find out who was responsible.

>Mr Stagg, a senior Labour left-winger, in a statement released late on Monday night admitted he was the politician who had been the subject of recent speculation in Irish newspapers. He accepted his conduct had been 'undoubtedly indiscreet' but not illegal.

>Mr Stagg, who is married with two children and has represented Kildare in the Dail since 1987, said he had been sitting in his car alone in Phoenix Park one evening last November when he was approached by **a man in his mid- twenties** on a bicycle. They had first talked through the window, then the man had got into the car. A police car pulled up soon after and officers asked Mr Stagg his name and told him 'in no uncertain terms' about the nature of the area and advised him to leave it.

>The minister said that 'although I became aware from our conversation that the man on the bicycle was gay, I was unaware - and still have no evidence to suggest - that he was male prostitute. I have never had any involvement with male prostitutes.' He said he deeply regretted the distress the incident had caused to his wife and family.

while labour positioned itself as a party for the working class few of its members actually are ordinary workers, so they are more acceptable to the rest of the establishment.

Sinn Féin on the other hand is made up of mostly working class people, you see this in some of the negative tropes about shinners all being dole scroungers, violent thugs etc. A lot of people either consciously or subconsciously don't like the idea of people from council estates having a say in running the country

Non shinner working class politicians face the same nonsense, a government politicians once told Lynn Ruane 'People like you never have had to make difficult choices in your life'

ALtough i'd doubt many people left in labour are any bit ideological or anti capitalist the party is well to the right of the rest of the left

the ego socialising and electioneering stuff probably applies to all parties though to some extent like I know people in PBP and Sinn féin who could do with some non political friends to balance them out.

I am surprised the accreditation body SACSCOC doesn’t have something nasty to say about the exclusion..

What exactly is the difference between doing your AA between 15-18 and 18-70?  The 15-18 year old is an over achiever seems a bit out of line for schools like UVA and W&M....

#Rules 

You will be nominating your least favorite songs from the chart. 

The nominations with the most upvotes will be eliminated from the contest. 

In order for your nomination to be considered, your nomination must... 

A) Directly mention nominating a song (I nominate _____, I'm voting ______, etc.) 

And B) Directly explain why you're nominating said song (I don't like _____, _____ is the worst song left, etc.) 

You cannot nominate multiple songs in a single comment. 

Defense posts can be used to take away votes from nominations, and will need opposite requirements for being considered (Mention you're defending a song, explain why, and don't defend multiple songs). 

Defense posts will only be counted during the elimination process if you also write a valid nomination for another song in another comment. 

If you choose to nominate/defend multiple songs via multiple comments, only your highest voted nomination and defense will be considered. 

Voting will end after around 24 hours (give or take depending on how soon I'm able to check votes), where a new round will begin with a specific number of songs removed, until only one song remains. 

Nominations will only count if the comment has more than one upvote, and the defense post against it has less upvotes than the nomination. 

**Not a requirement, but if a song you nominated/defended makes it to another round and you wish to nominate/defend it again, try and make sure your comments across multiple posts are original, as opposed to copying and pasting the same arguments. Essays might be allowed to appear in multiple posts depending on the length and complexity, but if your nominations/defenses are only a few sentences long, try and be original with each round.**",KaleBennett,2022-11-24,Ireland

Anyways, nominating Justice For All's *Reminiscence - Scars Etched By Flame*.

Once again, I sweep JFA's OST! No, but for real, I think this song should be out.

JFA's soundtrack is often considered to be the worst in the series, a sentiment I agree with. But I think Ini's tragedy overture should be out for a number of reasons.

For starters, this song is a little repetitive. Of course, that's not a bad thing, but, as I mentioned in my previous nomination, the other songs from JFA left are *excellent*. They are enjoyable tracks that leave a massive impact on the player for one reason or another, and while this song does exactly that... just look at the other Reminiscence theme left. It's *easily* the best in the trilogy, *perfectly* representing Godot's tragedy, but this song just isn't as memorable in comparison. I also think it's easily the least catchy song left, but that's more subjective.

So yeah. Because of the things I mentioned, I believe *Reminiscence - Scars Etched By Flame* should be out.",avoteforatishon2016,2022-11-24,Ireland

Gregson is one of my absolute favourite characters in all of Ace Attorney with a pretty great theme, but even I know to fold my cards when i see them. Compared to the other remaining detective themes which are either more musically iconic or help give a first impression of the character, Gregson is much more of a conventional detective, so he gets a more toned down, musically tame theme as a result, one which could also fit with several other characters. The slow nature of the song lends well for the developments in Gregson's character down the line, but in my opinion it's a track whose best quality is the character it's adjacent to, rather than the song itself. It is only after the player has gone through the duology that they will find the most enjoyment with Gregson's theme, whereas through the perspective of an isolated case like G1-4 or G2-2, it's merely a pretty chill detective theme and not much else.

TL;DR: it's a song that is primarily enhanced by the character, rather than one that enhances the character

What I always found interesting about Ace Attorney's music is that some tracks play severals instruments at different rythms at the same time. But this track takes it one step too far. At some points, there is so much going on in the song, that my brain cannot even comprehend what is going on in the song.  

Don't get me wrong, it's a good track. It always hypes you up when it's played. BUT! Therein lies its weakness! It's TOO HYPE for its own good. Allow me to compare it to Mario Kart:

When you're playing Mario Kart, it's all fun and games, until you get to the Final Lap. Then, the music just goes bananas, and you start throwing death threats over red shells. The hype music always fits in the moment, but if you're going to listen to the music afterwards? I'd always choose the regular version over the final lap version.

#Rules 

You will be nominating your least favorite songs from the chart. 

The nominations with the most upvotes will be eliminated from the contest. 

In order for your nomination to be considered, your nomination must... 

A) Directly mention nominating a song (I nominate _____, I'm voting ______, etc.) 

And B) Directly explain why you're nominating said song (I don't like _____, _____ is the worst song left, etc.) 

You cannot nominate multiple songs in a single comment. 

Defense posts can be used to take away votes from nominations, and will need opposite requirements for being considered (Mention you're defending a song, explain why, and don't defend multiple songs). 

Defense posts will only be counted during the elimination process if you also write a valid nomination for another song in another comment. 

If you choose to nominate/defend multiple songs via multiple comments, only your highest voted nomination and defense will be considered. 

Voting will end after around 24 hours (give or take depending on how soon I'm able to check votes), where a new round will begin with a specific number of songs removed, until only one song remains. 

Nominations will only count if the comment has more than one upvote, and the defense post against it has less upvotes than the nomination. 

**Not a requirement, but if a song you nominated/defended makes it to another round and you wish to nominate/defend it again, try and make sure your comments across multiple posts are original, as opposed to copying and pasting the same arguments. Essays might be allowed to appear in multiple posts depending on the length and complexity, but if your nominations/defenses are only a few sentences long, try and be original with each round.**",KaleBennett,2022-11-28,Ireland

I do kinda agree since the JFA soundtrack is overall the weakest, but that's still big oof. Regardless, I think some of the AAI1/2 tracks are overstaying their welcome, likely because not many people have played the games and therefore there aren't as many nominations.

I think it's too much for all 4 AAI1/2 Pursuit/Confrontation themes to still be here when we're already reaching top 30, they're all thematically similar so we really should start whittling them down. 

For that reason I nominate **Confrontation \~ Presto 2009** because the second half is just a key change of the first half, which at this point of the competition really isn't cutting it in terms of musical variation. I'd honestly have liked it more if the song just looped without the second half.

It's not a bad song, but the 2016 version is IMO one of the few cases where the updated version is completely superlative to the original. The electric guitar adds ***SO*** much to the song. Keeping the original instruments on top of that was also a genius move, as it allows for some really fun call-and-response segments between the guitar and the synthesized glockenspiel. The song feels so much fuller and brimming with character as a result of that interplay between the two lead instruments.

To be honest I do not get the appeal of this song. While I love the bass underneath the music the bleeping electronica melody absolutely grates on me. Still it wouldn't be so bad except then the music just absolutely explodes in a cacophony of noise in the second half. It really just doesn't seem to fit. Especially with a person like ""Uncle Ray."" Now maybe it's the fan translation and it's a lot better in the original but I don't see him as the goofy fun loving uncle. He's more the laid-back chill uncle who asks for hugs. Maybe it's the dialogue, maybe it's the posture, maybe it's the attitude; whatever it may be the song just never felt the right fit for his character.

Despite its short length, i simply think this theme is one of the most intense and hectic and atmospheric of the entire franchise. It's certainly the best allegro in my opinion, and I think I even prefer it to 2011's presto. It melds the modern and ominous aesthetic of Apollo justice into this allegro theme. All those lingering notes in the background, the electronic instruments made cross examining feel the most intimidating and eerie it has ever been. Apollo is a new, even more neurotic attorney in a world that's far more secretive and unwelcoming than it was before, and when he's faced with difficult testimony, this theme demonstrates that desperate struggle for Apollo to find the truth, clouded in a court that's stagnated for seven years. I don't think any other Ace attorney game has recaptured the sheer moodiness in Apollo justice's soundtrack, and the Allegro theme is one of the best examples of said mood.",lewmaunmilliman,2022-11-28,Ireland

I know it sounds crazy, but we are now in the top 30 remaining songs. Out of the remaining Great Ace Attorney themes, this one is my least favourite. It is a nice theme, but it didn't get me humming it after listening to it the first time, or after finishing the games. I think the orchestral nature of the GAA games weakens the melody in some tracks like this one, and it doesn't have the flair and creativity that Enoch Drebber's theme does.

We know that mutations includes mutations that are duplications of stretches of DNA which results in the genome having two copies of that section of DNA. This allows there to be an original doing the old job and over time a second a second mutated copy. With the original still there. An increase in measurable information.

Creationists evade giving an actual definition because then it could be quantified. They clearly do not want that so they don't  produce any quantified or even consistent definition.

Now using an original sentence in one file and two identical copies in a second and a third file with the original and a mutated version of the original.

File one
Shannon information is a definition that is not limited to bandwidth.

File two
Shannon information is a definition that is not limited to bandwidth.
Shannon information is a definition that is not limited to bandwidth.

File three
Shannon information is a definition that is not limited to bandwidth.
Shannon information is a clear definition that fits the case of DNA.

It is now easy to test the amount of MEASURABLE information. Something you Creationists clearly want to evade. I used 7zip's compression for all three.

Size of each file.
test1.7z - uncompressed 69 compressed 192 bytes 
test2.7z - uncompressed 144 compressed 200 bytes
test3.7z - uncompressed 143 compressed 227 bytes

#Rules 

You will be nominating your least favorite songs from the chart. 

The nominations with the most upvotes will be eliminated from the contest. 

In order for your nomination to be considered, your nomination must... 

A) Directly mention nominating a song (I nominate _____, I'm voting ______, etc.) 

And B) Directly explain why you're nominating said song (I don't like _____, _____ is the worst song left, etc.) 

You cannot nominate multiple songs in a single comment. 

Defense posts can be used to take away votes from nominations, and will need opposite requirements for being considered (Mention you're defending a song, explain why, and don't defend multiple songs). 

Defense posts will only be counted during the elimination process if you also write a valid nomination for another song in another comment. 

If you choose to nominate/defend multiple songs via multiple comments, only your highest voted nomination and defense will be considered. 

Voting will end after around 24 hours (give or take depending on how soon I'm able to check votes), where a new round will begin with a specific number of songs removed, until only one song remains. 

Nominations will only count if the comment has more than one upvote, and the defense post against it has less upvotes than the nomination. 

**Not a requirement, but if a song you nominated/defended makes it to another round and you wish to nominate/defend it again, try and make sure your comments across multiple posts are original, as opposed to copying and pasting the same arguments. Essays might be allowed to appear in multiple posts depending on the length and complexity, but if your nominations/defenses are only a few sentences long, try and be original with each round.**",KaleBennett,2022-11-25,Ireland

Five songs were removed with 45 remaining. Five songs will be removed this round.,"I nominate **Phoenix Wright - Objection! 2016** as my pick

Though this song is the most up-to-date form of his recurring objection theme since T&T, i honestly find it a bit of a step down from the 2013 version. The more orchestral, timeless feeling is replaced by more electronic instrumentation which personally just feels weaker. The gravitas of Phoenix's return symbolized in the 2013 version is also undercut by a version that... doesn't really have much new meaning to parse. For someone who has acquired a legend status by this point in the series, the song doesn't convey that sense of legacy all too much. It's still pretty great and has some of its own additions, but in my opinion I find it the most underwhelming of the main trios objection themes in SOJ, and frankly a bit forgettable in the long catalogue of objection themes in the series.

What I always found interesting about Ace Attorney's music is that some tracks play severals instruments at different rythms at the same time. But this track takes it just a bit too far. At some points, there is just too much going on in the song.

Don't get me wrong, it's a good track. It always hypes you up when it's played. BUT! Therein lies its weakness! It's TOO HYPE for its own good. Allow me to compare it to Mario Kart:

When you're playing Mario Kart, it's all fun and games, until you get to the Final Lap. Then, the music just goes bananas, and you start throwing death threats over red shells. The hype music always fits in the moment, but if you're going to listen to the music afterwards? I'd always choose the regular version over the final lap version.

If all other Pursuit themes are the ""regular"" tracks, Overtaken is the ""final lap"" version.

Sad to see but the competition is tough especially with only Investigation theme representing it.

Anyway time for my nomination and it's time to look at my favorite thing for this game's music and that's the overall context and for that reason I'm nominating **Turnabout Sisters Ballad**

What I mean by context is that the song is a beautiful piece for Maya's evolution of a character and her determination to improve herself at the end of the first game. However the whole context outside that game kinda puts a damper on that sentiment. Arguably Maya was at her most helpful in Turnabout Goodbyes, but afterwards she most only became helpful because she channeled namely Mia. Reunion, Mia. Farewell, a little bit her a little bit Mia, Recipe, Mia, and Bridge both Mia and Dahlia. Even Rite and Revolution she was only helpful when channelling. It's unfortunate that really her only good case without channelling was Stolen Turnabout by goading Phoenix to touch the urn and hitting the button.

And I'm going to pull for another song as well because if you want a Turnabout Sisters theme to go far, then Ending Theme from VS has you covered. Maya is such a fantastic character in the crossover game and her theme's inclusion in the Ending mashup of theme is highly indicative of that. It's a much more meaningful use of Turnabout Sisters and Maya as a character than the expectations Ballad set up but couldn't execute.",Zlpv7672,2022-11-27,Ireland

#Rules 

You will be nominating your least favorite songs from the chart. 

The nominations with the most upvotes will be eliminated from the contest. 

In order for your nomination to be considered, your nomination must... 

A) Directly mention nominating a song (I nominate _____, I'm voting ______, etc.) 

And B) Directly explain why you're nominating said song (I don't like _____, _____ is the worst song left, etc.) 

You cannot nominate multiple songs in a single comment. 

Defense posts can be used to take away votes from nominations, and will need opposite requirements for being considered (Mention you're defending a song, explain why, and don't defend multiple songs). 

Defense posts will only be counted during the elimination process if you also write a valid nomination for another song in another comment. 

If you choose to nominate/defend multiple songs via multiple comments, only your highest voted nomination and defense will be considered. 

Voting will end after around 24 hours (give or take depending on how soon I'm able to check votes), where a new round will begin with a specific number of songs removed, until only one song remains. 

Nominations will only count if the comment has more than one upvote, and the defense post against it has less upvotes than the nomination. 

**Not a requirement, but if a song you nominated/defended makes it to another round and you wish to nominate/defend it again, try and make sure your comments across multiple posts are original, as opposed to copying and pasting the same arguments. Essays might be allowed to appear in multiple posts depending on the length and complexity, but if your nominations/defenses are only a few sentences long, try and be original with each round.**",KaleBennett,2022-11-27,Ireland

It's a great track but it falls short of the rest of the bangers left, including ones from it's own game.

I mean, I'm all for bringing science into discussions to replace heresay but, while I've seen many Dublin fans argue against this point but I've seen very few, if any at all, make the point that higher population is a disadvantage.

&#x200B;

The problem that always comes up in these discussions on both sides is that people always focus on one thing. One person claims it's the money that make Dublin win. Another says it's the population. And because of that focus on one thing the debate always descends into crap.

&#x200B;

Dublin have a higher chance of success because of a myriad of things. They already have many natural advantages. Population, population density, infrastructure, economic level and marketability to name a few. Then the GAA make that worse by providing more funding, more promotion, more marketing, less travel etc.

&#x200B;

Even if it was just the population, what could we do? Restrict the number of people who can play in counties? The majority of people who I've seen asked about it are against breaking Dublin up too.

As with the population thing ya it’s an advantage but I think people make it out to be more of an advantage than it really is, look at China there not contenders for the world cup even tho they have the biggest population in the world and Iceland have been successful in recent years even tho there population is tiny even compared to Ireland hell even nothern Ireland aren’t doing too bad even tho they only have 1.8 million people.",WindowLicker1709,2019-09-19,Ireland

You are completely misrepresenting the paper you link to. The paper is about pure athletic ability. People with freak athletic ability will always be more common in countries with a larger population size. 

Football isn't just about athletic ability. Its a team sport and as much about tactics and skill as athletic ability. What makes Dublin good is not just their athletic ability. 

I'm not a Dub and I'm not saying they don't have an advantage but let's not misrepresent journal articles to try and badly prove a point. 

If the funding issue was tackled properly first we'd see a more level playing field, breaking up Dublin should be last resort. It would be bad for the game overall.",charkilo,2019-09-19,Ireland

I never got to try 2c-t-7; however I did try 2c-t-2 numerous times which is supposed to be similar but worse then t-7? I imagine t-7 would fit up up top as well. T-2 while magical had too many body taxing elements to make the cut. 

Sadly, Shulgin assumed dosesges would be similar to other 2cs which all have (relatively the same dose range give or take 10 to 15mg). 2c-p is an exceptionn. He tried 2c-c at 40mg high end and quit. 40mg is low common end in my experience. Psychonsut wiki lists 80mg plus as ""heavy."" I struggle with this but I do think at 80mg the drug shows it's potential, 70 to 80. It is here in my experience cognitive effects mostly peak like headspace.

Visuals and body sensations and euphoria however continue to rise at higher doses without much extra thought perception change. 100mg-120mg this one SHINES. It finally gains profound visuals worthy of a psychsdelic with intensity of probably 350ug of LSD. I remained far more lucid though but the drug felt whole and complete unlike 25i which has insane visuals with an odd empty shallow headspace.

It also never had any noticeable physical side effects. 2c-Calm. It was sedating if anything compared ed to most psychs but nothing to put you to sleep it was a deep relaxation. It felt so benign.

It probably depends on how many women there are, but it's hard to see them choose 6-9 forwards without including key promotional athletes.  


By my count, of the 12 forwards ahead of Nurse in PHWPA scoring, 2 aren't in the game. Of the remaining 10, 2 have already had MSPs. Nurse did as well, but it was literally the first event.

Admittedly, Knight is 21st in scoring among PHWPA forwards but this is in part due to having played less games. She is still the most iconic American woman, and of the 21 ahead of her, 10 don't have base cards (I think aren't in the game at all?) and 4 have already had MSPs.

---

This format looks like it'll be tough for me, there are players I want pretty evenly spread out across all of the groups, but I'll be lucky to afford more than one or two in total because I put all my resources elsewhere instead.

Here's a list of the players I would want:

- Connor Bedard (I have his MSP)

- Jeremy Swayman (I'll probably skip him since he's the only other player in that group I want and it's not worth spending anything to try to get a goalie)

- Tage Thompson (no way I'll be able to afford this one on the market, I'd probably need to get him randomly, if they still do the random packs the same way this year, which is unlikely considering how many things they increased the prices of and lowered the odds this year)

- Dougie Hamilton

- Charlie McAvoy (I have his MSP, but I'll still probably skip him. I had his 99 EVO card last year and he's just too small for an endgame defenseman to me. Come to think of it, I don't think I actually upgraded his MSP because I picked Bergeron for that event's collectibles, so that definitely makes him an easier decision to skip)

- David Pastrnak (I have his MSP, but it's only an 88, so that upgrade isn't going to be cheap)

- Victor Hedman (I have his X-Factor up to date, so maybe he wouldn't cost too much?)

- Linus Ullmark (could probably skip because of the goalie thing)

- Patrice Bergeron (I have his MSP)

- Alexander Ovechkin (I hope he would have Truculence. I know the X-Factor and Clutch Moments cards do, but I haven't been able to afford either of those)

So that's ten players I'd want (eight if you cut out the goalies), when I'll probably struggle to afford two. That should be interesting. I didn't include McDavid and MacKinnon because I have those TOTY cards, so they shouldn't cost me anything, and I probably won't use the TOTS cards over them anyway, unless they change how the card artwork for TOTS works.",deathjohnson1,2023-03-06,Ireland

Can I get your criticism?","This is quite good. I have just a couple of things I'd like to point out.   
  
First, for the whole essay, I'd be fine if you just called them LEDs the entire way through. I see no reason to spell out the acronym at any point when it is clearly defined once at the beginning. Presumably, I'm reading this all at once. I can remember what LED means for the five minutes that I'm reading this.    

In the first paragraph, I stumbled across ""However, in order to construct something as common as an up-to-date traffic light, solid-state physics had to undergo..."" because the phrase ""in order to"" sets the mind up for causality and none is provided. I would suggest editing the sentence to ""solid-state physics *has* had to undergo..."" (as in the sentence ""I have to go"") because this way causality is shown: in order to, they have had to.

Under science that enlightens, I followed you until ""...the preeminence of luminescence as a prevalent production of lightbulbs is imminent..."" I got what you said on the second time around, but I'd like to understand the first way through, so if you could make that more simpler for my puny human brain that would be quite nice. After that phrase, you can skip right over to ""Luminescence is the emission..."" I don't actually need the other stuff. You say it later.     

Moving on. I understood you through ""Physicists and photons"" cause I'm a bit of a nerd, but I'm going to have to trust you on ""Breaking through."" Thankfully, nothing popped out at me in that section. I wouldn't have known what to tell you.     

Overall, I really liked it. I feel like I learned something. I hope you do quite well for yourself in this challenge, and I hope that in some way I can help you.",Neruda06,2014-12-27,Ireland

It sounds like you are a highly conscientious person (i.e. You love to work and be productive). If this is the case, hats off that you are figuring this out so early!

Since your goal is to be an entrepreneur, you are starting the journey off correctly by getting your hands dirty in lots of different school projects.

With all your questions, an interview I heard a while back comes to mind  I think it was with Peter Thiel. Anyway, he said something like : 'The market is flooded with so-called ""entrepreneurs"" spending years getting MBAs and business degrees. You would be far better off spending those years studying programming and developing a skillset which can then solve the real problems'.

As an example, look to the Collison brothers. They were not business men starting off. But they identified a problem, built a small solution and then a business developing that solution to a large scale. What made them successful initially was not their business savvy (which they were subsequently mentored in), but their technical abilities. Patrick Collison has a good blog you can check out.

Regarding your question on LC subjects. Do the subjects you **enjoy** doing. Unless you need high points for a course, pick the subjects you enjoy doing and do well in them. Computer science could be a nice one if you enjoy programming already!

Overall, you obviously have a lot of ideas and pretty cool goals at your age. I didn't answer a some of your questions, because it is clear to me you need some sort of mentor to advise you. I cannot advise on this because it is not an area I am intimate with. However, I know myself that when I want a mentor in an area, I look first to books.

I will finish with two thoughts.

1. Learn to write well. I wish I knew this in TY, but I have only learned it in my late twenties. Writing makes you powerful, sharp and will increase your success.
2. Plan out your future. I've taken this self authoring course that has been extremely effective in my twenties: [https://www.selfauthoring.com/future-authoring](https://www.selfauthoring.com/future-authoring)   
It has mixed results for students in secondary school (since most 16 year olds can't see past 6 months in the future) but I think it will help you a great deal.

TL;DR

* Read lots.
* Learn to write well.
* Write a plan for your future.
* Most importantly - Work hard at what you enjoy!",cauliflower93,2021-10-01,Ireland

Best advice I can give you is don't go into software development only for the money. Yes it pays well and there's an abundance of jobs, but these courses have high dropout rates from people who go into it for only those reasons. They then realise it's not for them, and either drop out, or do just well enough to get by and then go into IT support roles or else just an unrelated field entirely.

I'm not saying you have to be super into it to do well in it, but if engineering genuinely interests you more than computer science, go for engineering. There's loads of ways into IT work. Physics is another good option, I've worked with a lot of guys who did Physics and then went into software development.

Also Comp Sci is going to very in-depth and ""academic"" for lack of a better word. If you just want to be able to build websites/apps but don't want to know the finer details of how networking and operating systems work, you should go for a more practical software dev course.",AudioManiac,2021-10-01,Ireland

For example, in TCD you do 2 years of general engineering and then in 3rd year your choose your speciality, so you either pick Computer, Mechanical, Biomedical, etc and you get an engineering degree in that specialty. This means that in 1st and 2nd year you get lots of exposure to different types of engineering disciplines and then you can choose the one you like best in 3rd year.

As far as entrepreneurship engineering is a decent degree to have. I know lots of people that have mechanical or civil engineering degrees and have gone on to start or join companies in a totally different area (e.g. finance, marketing, etc.).",if_username_is_true,2021-10-01,Ireland

Anything comp sci. related you can learn on your own time, the other three will serve you well whatever career your applying for in the tech industry.   
Any Computer Science degree will be useful for a software dev role, but specifically the following:   

Software Development    
Software Engineering     
Electronic Engineering     
And I've even seen some people with Mechanical Engineering degrees have an easier time getting into software dev.  
Personally I like the Electronic Engineering degrees as they will most definitely include programming, but also include hardware architecture and building things like computers and robots.    
My degree, which I didn't do in Ireland was Software Development and Electronic Engineering, which gave me a solid foundation in both, with the main focus on software engineering.    
If I could do it again I would have gone for pure Electronic Engineering, as the first couple of years were the same, but the final year was focused on building robotics and the electronics side of IoT projects.",bot_bot_bot,2021-10-02,Ireland

Not above VT in CS but two others on the list state-wise: W&L seems to carry itself pretty well, and W&M has very hands on learning with students recurrently enrolling in high end programs like MIT (for MS and PhD) after. I’m assuming you’re not checking outside the state for undergrad. 
Now… Is this new curriculum something you can handle? If it’s the same classes (essentially) and you can’t change degree label again, maintain the high GPA through graduation and you should be fine. 
Also, general advice, but ensure your writing portions and anything you can do outside of school to boost your profile are in check when applying. The academics are a huge portion but as always, they’ll consider everything else you have going.",da_bear_necessities,2022-03-03,Ireland

# Summary:

* '**Everything so far is looking great**'! 
* Still trying to 'get to know' Webb

Two concerns over last few days, now fixed:

* 1: Solar arrays were not operating as well as expected. Now corrected, everything's 'nominal', power has increased. Now, no issues with power.
* 2: Sunshield motor temperatures higher than expected. Re-pointed Webb to allow motors to cool more. Now being used to tension sunshield.
* Observatory was never in danger.

Sunshield tensioning

* 'The next big challenge'.
* Today tensioning of sunshield layer 1 begins! Will take 'most of the day'. To tension all layers will take 2-3 days. Will go cautiously, don't want to burn out the team. Probably done on wednesday.
* Surprise at how well the deployment telemetry has matched expectations so far.
* 6 motors involved in tensioning all 5 layers. Can pause at any time if issues arise. Designed to be snag-free. 'Expect to have smooth-sailing' ;) Currently in the 'pre-activities phase', layer 1 tensioning likely to start in a few hours.
* When all five layers are tensioned, 70-75% of the 344 single point failures will be passed :)

Future

* Probably 'by end of week', will be deploying secondary mirror.
* Fuel savings from near-perfect launch & burns: lifetime now 'a lot more than 10 years' (no precise lifetime length yet though).",Pluto_and_Charon,2022-01-03,Ireland

It lasted a total of 65 minutes. From this, we can do some simple math to get a rough estimate of how much delta-v was involved in this manoeuvre. One 8lbf SCAT (Secondary Combustion Augmented Thrusters) burning hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide was most likely used, which Wikipedia says have a specific impulse of 295 seconds. (65 X 60 X 8)/295= 105.75 lbs of prop. Assuming a launch mass of 13,584lbs and the 295s isp, this is a delta-v of roughly 23m/s out of a total spacecraft delta-v of roughly 150m/s or so (of which based on some napkin math, very roughly 110m/s is from the SCAT thrusters, the rest is hydrazine only). A little extra delta-v was probably used by the MRE-1 thrusters to keep it stable during the manoeuvre. 

There are a total of 4 SCAT thrusters (8lbf each and burn hydrazine + N2O4) and 16 MRE-1 thrusters (1lbf hydrazine only). The SCAT's are in two redundant pairs, one pair for MCC-1a (which was just completed) and MCC-1b. The other pair is for MCC-2 and for stationkeeping during the rest of the JWST's service life. The reason they need these two separate pairs is that during the deployment sequence the centre of mass changes, and they need both pairs to be firing through the centre of mass, otherwise they would waste a ton of hydrazine keeping it from tumbling from the off-axis thrust.

This is all speculation and my rough estimates. I could very well be off.",NTKV,2021-12-26,Ireland

TL;DR the primary sensors that were there to confirm that the sunshield cover had completely unrolled didn't go off (though secondary and tertiary ones did) so out of an abundance of caution they waited in the morning to confirm that the sunshield cover was completely off and safely out of the way before they started the boom deployment today.

>We've been hearing you loud and clear: Why doesn't Webb have cameras for its journey to #UnfoldTheUniverse? It sounds like a no-brainer, but there's more to it than meets the lens. Thread ⬇️ https://t.co/CrurG7OZgW

>1. Light 💡

>Our gold-coated mirrors were photogenic on Earth, but the mirror side of Webb is pitch dark in space. Meanwhile, the other, Sun-facing side of Webb is so shiny that cameras there would have glare & contrast issues.

>2. Power 🔌

>We would have to run cables and power out to cameras on Webb, and the power balance on the cold side of Webb is especially delicate. More cables adds more of a threat of heat and vibration transfer through the wires, which could impact image quality.

>3. Temperature 🥶

>A camera that would work at the cryogenic temperatures on the cold side of the sunshield would have to be specially designed. Plastics fall apart, shrink, and crack, and glues don’t hold together.

>4. Complexity 🛠️

>Webb is big and changes configuration during deployments. Where do you put cameras? How many? Narrow-field ones add complexity; wide-field ones don’t give detailed information.",Stupid_Idiot413,2022-01-06,Ireland

Sun shield deployment didn't hit any snags. Current onboard telemetry being received matches the ground testing very very closely.

Today starting tensioning of layer 1 will take most of the day. Remaining tensioning over the course of ~3 days. Maybe layer 2 tomorrow. Once 5 layers tensioned of the launch's 344 single points of failure, 75% will be retired.

* Power subsystem issue - solar array (5 panels) had factory set duty cycle of 58.6v. They always had plans to change it, but are changing it earlier to get more power generation ""rebalance the array.""  After balancing, they vary between 65v and 69v. The variance is determined by the panels' temperatures. Higher temp -> less efficiency -> lower duty cycle limit. It was never power starved; never power negative.

* Motor temperature issue - the team desires a large margin, and the motors were warmer than they wanted. They adjusted the attitude in order to make the motors cooler. Expected temp 320K currently 327K, the limit is 340K during operation. the limits not during operation is much higher (unspecified.) If the limit is reached during operation, it would not be catastrophic but the operation would pause with the ability to resume later. 6 motors drive all 5 layers.",vorin,2022-01-03,Ireland

>**Deployment Timeline Adjusted as Team Focuses on Observatory Operations**

>Taking advantage of its flexible commissioning schedule, the Webb team has decided to focus today on optimizing Webb’s power systems while learning more about how the observatory behaves in space. As a result, the Webb mission operations team has moved the beginning of sunshield tensioning activities to no earlier than tomorrow, Monday, Jan. 3. This will ensure Webb is in prime condition to begin the next major deployment step in its unfolding process.  

>Specifically, the team is analyzing how the power subsystem is operating now that several of the major deployments have been completed. Simultaneously, the deployments team is working to make sure motors that are key to the tensioning process are at the optimal temperatures prior to beginning that operation. 

>Using an approach to keep mission operations focused on as few activities as necessary at a time, mission managers have chosen to wait to resume sunshield deployment steps after better understanding the details of how Webb is functioning in its new environment. 

>“Nothing we can learn from simulations on the ground is as good as analyzing the observatory when it’s up and running,” said Bill Ochs, Webb project manager, based at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “Now is the time to take the opportunity to learn everything we can about its baseline operations. Then we will take the next steps.”

Of the three ways an object can get rid of heat JWST can't conduct (disperse heat through a solid) or convect (disperse heat through a liquid or a gas) and instead has to rely on radiation which is essentially the heat leaving the telescope as individual photons. This is VERY inefficient and takes a long time and so even though Webb is now fully in darkness and has all its shield layers deployed it'll still take awhile for it to cool down. As an aside this is also why the remnants of sun like stars, White Dwarfs, live so long. Even though White Dwarfs no longer make energy via fusion and are essentially the glowing embers of a dead star they are SO hot at birth that they will still glow with heat as they radiate for many many billions of years after the end of the star's life.

Edit: One engineering issue as well at the moment, the telescope still has to deploy the radiator for the science instruments that gather the light from behind the mirror. The instruments create heat as they operate of course, and so the telescope won't be able to fully start its complete cool down process until the radiator situated behind the mirror is fully deployed as well.",ReturnOfDaSnack420,2022-01-04,Ireland

So, it only takes a month for the telescope to reach the Lagrange point, but it will sit there for six months because it needs to cool down to 6 Kelvin (-448°F). When it has cooled down this much, it will have equivalent abilities to an instrument sitting on the Moon able to read the heat signature of a bug on Earth.

>The DTA extended about 48 inches (1.22 meters), putting room between the upper section of the observatory, which houses the mirrors and scientific instruments, and the spacecraft bus, which holds the electronics and propulsion systems. This creates enough distance to allow the sensitive mirrors and instruments to cool down to the necessary temperatures to detect infrared light. This gap will also provide room for the sunshield membranes to fully unfold.

Now allow me to use an anecdote. As a Med student, we are taught to read different test results to diagnose diseases, whether it be blood composition, EKG etc. But in an exam, we don’t use a real patients test results, our questions would be based off a fictional patient with fictional test results, which we would infer to produce diagnosis based on *real* diseases. That’s where the *real* part comes in. The patient and the test may be fake, but the logic that we use in our diagnosis is very much real, and so will be the potential disease and treatments that we write into the answer box.

The same concept applies to Mona, which is why I’m pretty sure she’s well aware that the stars are fake. To Mona, whether the stars are real is unimportant. What’s important is that she can read them, and that the divinations they produce are accurate. A fake sky to read off a *real* divination of a *real* fate.",YesNoImeanYesPlease,2022-11-07,Ireland

It can be hard when you are young to go against advice of parents, and they generally mean well, but more often then not they absolutely haven't a breeze about modern careers or industry, particular when they are from older generations. This is a good cautionary tale for younger people out there to get a larger sample size of advice when making important decisions in your life!  


First off fair play to you on making the decision, and don't be listening to people in your life who may be saying stuff like it's too late or whatever, rubbish. You got 30 years minimum left in your career, thats a long time to be working at something you've no interest in.  


I'm not up to date on the eligibility requirements but Springboard is definitely a good launchpad to get into the industry, as self taught is a tougher sell to employers here (maybe not impossible, but tough). Springboard will give you a good structured course and a recognised qualification at the end of it. Some offer the option of doing an internship in final semester which can be hard to justify financially, but if you can manage it can give you some experience or a foot in the door to a company.

You'll get some good advice here on this sub but feel free to DM if you want to ask questions, I'll be happy to answer and hopefully it can help you plan.",CaptainLofi600,2022-10-25,Ireland

You have had an almost identical experience to me but I didn’t stay in construction for ten years only 3.

I’m in my second year of a HDip and have already go an it job that I’m doing full time alongside the course. It’s in support but I’m in a small team and getting exposure to development with the progression plan of moving into development over time. Salary is 35k which is less than what you are on but about the same as what I was on in construction.

So it is definitely possible to do the move. However things do seem to be changing in IT, I was probably two years to late making the move and consider myself lucky to have gotten the job I have as there are many grad without jobs. So I’m not sure what it will be like in 1 - 2 years for you.

But I would 100% recommend getting out of construction. Looking back I don’t know how I did it. I used to be up at 6 in the morning to go to work and back at 7. Now I log in at five to nine wfh and turn my laptop off at 5. I would never go back.

I believe GMIT do one and I think (don’t quote me on this) that they offer a guaranteed internship. If there’s the option to transfer to a masters I would recommend doing that to help get your foot in the door for interviews a bit easier. I also think the GMIT one specialises in Java, make sure you find out which primary language will be used in advance so you can prepare for it. Obviously a bsc trumps the other options in terms of employer consideration but for the sake of time a conversion might be best, and there’s enough jobs going. 

Conversions require a lot of consistent work and late hours, even part time I believe. 

In terms of Kilkenny specifically I do know of one person working for an it security firm so there are jobs.

Special events can be activated regardless of the ending you reach. However, they cannot be activated on a scene (i.e. round of combat) that ends with a choice of dialogue, so be mindful of the script if you want to try this out yourself. You also cannot trigger the event on the scene that the film ends.

Urey that provided the very first  concrete relationship between Milankovitch's theory and the actual geological record using O18/16 isotopes on foraminifera from a core obtained by Lamont in the Caribbean. Hays et al at Lamont knocked down those initial findings before adopting them as their own. Did you attend UC or Harvard?

FYI. Emiliani also predicted that our expected climate/collapse SHTF would be 2024 in his later years before his passing in 1995. A true genius IMHO.

Parking isnt that great. Only lot near the arena is a paid lot which you have to buy a pass in advance.  Other lots are like a 10min walk across campus, but make sure you know where you are going before you get here.

Concession stand sucks. Yes, I said stand.  Eat dinner before you come and just buy drinks/snacks.  The pizza is the worst i've ever had. Seriously the worst. And i've eaten gas station pizza. Ive eaten no-frills pizza with fake mozzarella cheese.

Waltham has some really nice restaurants on Moody St (about 10min drive) so its a great place to grab some pregame dinner/drinks.  Also some great options up by 128/95 Totten Pond Rd exit if you're coming from that way. No food really close by though.

They also have ""The Cube"" which is a glassed-in area where they host pregame functions and sometimes offer passes to general public to eat/drink in there... not worth it.  did it for a playoff game and the food was mediocre at best.

In the meantime, you can try to figure some of that out yourself.  First, it is best to start with the Mason Core classes.

Also, here is the list of Nova classes that transfer to Mason and meet the Mason Core (general education) requirements:    
[https://advising.gmu.edu/mason-core-vccs-equivalency/](https://advising.gmu.edu/mason-core-vccs-equivalency/)

All Mason students need one Eng 111, two Lab Science classes, and one class of each of these:  Communications, Western Civilization, Social Science, Global Understanding, Literature, Arts.  For those transferring from a non-English-speaking HS, you also need Eng 112 or pass the TOEFL exam.

  
Also, for the classes that are specific to a major, lookup your major here - this is a list of all of the Nova to mason transfer guides;  
[https://www.nvcc.edu/transfer/mason/transfer-guides.html](https://www.nvcc.edu/transfer/mason/transfer-guides.html)

Those transfer guides above are sometimes a bare minimum information - so I suggest also to find the Mason department website for the major that you want to do a Mason.  And see if they have any transfer guides / documents posted.  You can also try contacting advisors listed on that department webpage and see if they will make an appt - but many times they only make appts with existing students.

Finishing a whole AS degree is useful only if you want it for your resume, or you know for a fact that it will get you into Guaranteed Admission at Mason.  There are other GAA rules you must meet, so make sure you read all of them.  Many students think they are getting GAA but don't read the fine print, so then they don't get it.  But the only big advantage to GAA is that they may waive all of those Mason Core requirements I listed above.  That means if you already have all of your Mason Core, then GAA is not really needed.",Advising_Help_1024,2022-01-20,Ireland

All letter grades from NVCC turn to T's on your transcript and I think C is the lowest threshold for an acceptable transfer credit.

*What is and what is to come*

Things are looking great for the Broncos. The school has made it a priority to win a national championship in hockey within the next 10 years. Andy Murray is solid behind the bench, and the Broncos are looking to compete as they transition into the NCHC against some of the best teams in the country. In the works is a rumored $60M new hockey arena, and WMU getting it done on the recruiting trail.

Of course that’s assuming you have a good gpa (3.5+) to remove any doubt that you’d get in.

Some climate change is anthropogenic.  There you go, are you satisfied?  No of course not.

The Alarmist sleight of hand is to leap directly from ""some climate change is anthropogenic"" to ""fossil fuel use must be banned by 2050.""  But the key parameter - climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling - is the subject of a huge scientific dispute.  The controversy is so fierce that, for the first time, the IPCC did not identify a most likely value of climate sensitivity in its most recent report.

The controversy has been caused in no small measure by the complete failure of climate studies practitioners - and particularly those constructing the IPCC report - to predict the lack of warming over the last 18+ years - despite ever rising CO2.  They didn't predict the last 18 years.  There's no reason we should have confidence that they know what will happen in the next 18 years.

It matters because fossil fuels have been directly responsible for liberating 100s of millions of people from poverty in the last 18 years.  And, if there is no emergency, no catastrophe, then we should let them finish the job.  Then adapt and mitigate as necessary in the context of an educated, high tech world.  All the trillions requested by Climate Alarmists are still nothing compared to the opportunity cost of leaving 100s of millions of people in grinding poverty.

Every outlandish Alarmist scenario has been debunked multiple times - including the most basic one, that climate sensitivity is high.  Climate changes with time scales on the order of 1000s of years.  There is no hurry.  There is no emergency.  We have time to lift people out of poverty first with organic economic growth.

Even if one of the exceedingly unlikely Alarmist scenarios begins to play out.  We will detect it - it certainly won't look like no warming for 18 years - and we will use some of the now vast number of geoengineering techniques to mitigate it and prevent catastrophe.  Not only will the cost be vastly less than the opportunity cost of energy poverty, it will be orders of magnitude less than the trillions currently being demanded for the war on climate change.  

The risk is capped.  Your catastrophe is off the table.  Your only remaining decision is how long you will force people to wait to emerge from energy poverty.  You can't dismiss their suffering with an offer of [0.15% the power of a Californian](http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/programs/energy-and-climate/the-low-energy-club) as the Sierra Club did.  That is wicked and cruel.  As you will realize if you put yourself in their shoes.

I have never made someome feel as if they weren't worth my time, even though I am pretty introverted as a whole.

So you want to make Ryunosuke pull the same stunt that Susato did with the flapomat in 1-5 - setting up the intrigue with Sholmes (despite being one of main characters) and reveal it later in the climax

The idea of one big, grand Summation examination with jurors being high-ranked judicial officers does sound interesting, and I even entertained the idea a little bit myself (which I picked up from the good perople in this sub). Like, the trial goes as it did in canon, the gallery (as are the jurors in this version, too) start to chant Stronghart's name, but then Barok pulls an objection and tells Ryu:

>Van Zieks: Mister Naruhodo... I hope you remember well the first day of our first encounter  
>  
>Ryunosuke: The first day? What do you mean?  
>  
>Van Zieks: Well clearly, I mean that you impressed me the very moment I saw you in action... Because you ended up reviving one of the old customs of The Old Bailey curtrooms  
>  
>Susato: I think I know what he means! Do you remember, Mr. Naruhodo? You performed a summation examination for the first time of many years!  
>  
>Ryunosuke: Oh, right!

And then the examination starts with yet another epic rendition of the musical theme. And this somehow helps heroes to bring down Mael Stronghart, explaining that the vigilantism is bad etc. That would be a great example of integrating the gameplay and the story, as you said, but I feel like there were little opportunities to pull this thing in the game

I disagree with you about DoD, though. To me the final dance with Sholmes and Mikotoba was climactic enough - the fact of reunion of famous partners thrills, cool music plays, tap dancing rocks and the deductions themselves are not noticeably harder, but there's no second guess which creats the feeling of urgency

Stronghart himself isn't my favorite villain ever, but I wouldn't say he's a twist villain. He was imposing and threatening enough, but ultimately for the most time he was like an NPS from rpg games who gives quests to the player",etermellis,2022-04-11,Ireland

There are of course complications with the optics being different at lower wavelengths and having trouble finding physical ways to make lenses and stuff.

You are totally right about how subjective it all is. The one thing I noticed from your comparisons was that the Scarlet Study version was a lot more raw and ""savage"". Asougi and Auchi were hurling insults at each other openly in the supreme court.  In Capcom's version, they were a lot more coy about it. I'm happy with both versions.



While you loved the character voice of the soldier, I'm worried if it will get too suffocating. Capcom's version his lines were a lot more creative and funny, but Scarlet Study's version is how I would expect an actual soldier to talk on a witness stand. Over voicing was at its worst in Dual Destinies, especially with Solomon Starbuck. Spoilers ahead for DD, he made so many space references, I couldn't wait to be done with his cross examination. 



Ironically, my favorite exchange from DD also comes from Solomon Starbuck. In 5-5, when you're investigating the Space Center again this time to prove Athena innocent, you meet him there, freshly released. He recalls how he crossed paths with Athena while she was getting arrested and he was getting released. Her eyes were red and swollen from crying but when she saw him, she didn't want him to feel responsible so she smiled and gave him a victory sign and congratulated him for his acquittal. Starbuck then said he was okay with going back to jail if it means she gets to go free, because she didn't deserve it. This exchange gave Starbuck far more character than any of his 500 space references. 




I can already tell replaying The Great Ace Attorney 1 will be a lot more than just a recalling of what happened in the fan translation for me. I will miss the classic lines like ""Are all Russians inherently suspicious? Or are all suspicious people inherently Russian?"" and ""Yes?

To me, the official translation, probably by nature of it being official, feels more like an Ace Attorney game. Capcom decided a while ago to make the dialogue easy-to-understand yet often over-the-top and ""quirky"", for lack of a better term.

The Scarlet Study version, on the other hand, feels more plain and academic and often reads like a student essay. It works better here than one of the Ace Attorney games that takes place in the 2010s onwards but it still feels a little out of place from what I've come to expect from the Ace Attorney games. And that's not even to say that the official one is inaccurate to the period. People certainly talked like that, but it's more the cliche of older people to be more formal and proper than to let their emotions get the best of them. There are fewer individual sentences where you can nitpick the accuracy, but overall, I do like the direction the official translation has gone with better.

Also an associates in CS is meaningless if u end up getting a bachelors. Realistically CS associates in one year is impossible because you got calc I-III, chemistry, physics I and ii, and possibly differential equations, linear algebra, discrete math and so on. My advice is you should try to fulfill ur target schools first year requirements and some more, and apply to transfer as a rising sophomore.

Why are dubs such whines? You're nearing a  decade of absolute dominance here and you're complaining that people don't speak positively about yous enough, when it's only now the Dublin white elephant is even half-heartedly being discussed after destroying another romantic all ireland run without breaking a sweat. 



My teams won 3 all irelands altogether, from before they even won their first one I've been listening to pundits actively hate on my team, which only worsened as they succeeded, to the point where there were new rules introduced to curb how they play by the time they were playing the third all ireland. (is the new handpass rule defunct? I feel like I haven't seen it enforced in nearing a decade). 


.

From as a far back as I can remember I've been listening to shite leveled at my team from the top down, early memories of pundits actually properly seething, blood vessels to the eyeballs like some firebrand preacher moralising the virtues of ""good"" football. This was before we had even won the ireland, and we were already getting talked about like Public Enemy number 1

But nah its little ol Dublin, who in their period in ""the wilderness"" didn't even drop outside of the Top 10 and still boasted some of the best talent in the country, one of the few teams in either code to boast double figure all irelands, Dublin who have been head and shoulders above everyone for a decade but don't see it beneath them to engage in puke football and pull downs, Dublin who have been getting smoke blown up their hole pretty much constantly since the first winning campaign and who probably have the most minutes of analytical coverage broadcast out of any other football team; and your complaint is yous are never praised or given positive attention?

Also would be interesting to look at their success rate of drug approval, if it is a stat that we can see, and maybe the history of approved drugs. 

Having worked in a research center that studied rare diseases, one of the key problems about this is the lack of agregated data and/or the lack of patient regrouped at a same place. I think people that endeavor to cure these unlucky sick people are great, even if they're partly in it for the money. From personal experience, patients don't really care if the medication is developped for profit (for example in canada, if an hospital research center finds a cure, they prob wont be able to sell for a high profit, probably like minimum price or something.

You cannot register for classes until you have completed orientation, at least that's how it was for me in 2020. Your advisor will be who ever is assigned to your last name in your department of study.  You can find this info online. 

2. No, unless those credits do not transfer to the mason core requirements 

3. Yes probably. It's not always a 1-1 transfer, check with your advisor. If you can access patriot web and degree works you should be able to see what transfers to what. I think additionally if you are coming from NVCC they have a transfer calculator to see what NVCC classes transfer as. 

4. Traffic is slowly but surely picking back up to precovid levels and it will probably be back to normal come fall. I live less than 30 miles from campus and it takes about an hour to get to campus (not including parking and walking to where I need to go) during AM rush hour (730-930am). I specifically avoid leaving campus during rush hour PM (4-6pm) because no thank you. 

5. Attend the transfer events/seminars. I'm assuming you are transfering from NVCC? GMU has 100x more programs/services than NVCC and I would have known about exactly zero had I not attended the transfer event that I did.

And for the Wh40k bit, pretty much everyone bar the Necrons and Tyranids uses or can use travel through the Immaterium (Warp) for travel, although Eldar don't use it often for damn good reason.

Drives that travel through an ""under/overspace"" in which said space can be lightly described as Hell or Hell's Worst Nightmare should fall under the classification of Hell drives.

Also, glad to see someone remembered Supernova 2000 and the D-Jump sequences.

Edit: Not quite sure if this is a viable suggestion, but there's a KSP mod for FTL beacons.

It has 2 components:

1. The FTL Target Beacon

2. The FTL Drive unit itself

The Beacon must be in orbit around a target body before the drive can jump, and the only real way to do that is the hard way, real-space transit. The FTL drive unit is part of the craft that jumps, and uses an FTL beacon for nav data to get from point A to point B.

Couple limitations to it though:

1. The Targeting Beacon AND the jumping spacecraft cannot be too deep within a gravity well, else the drive(s) cannot bend space enough to jump. Attempting an underpowered jump runs the risk of fragging your ship.

2. Beacons must transit to the destination the hard way, which takes time.

3. Additional jump power can be provided by adding more drives, but more drives = more mass, and diminishing returns will make adding more than 4-5 drives pointless. In addition, more drives = more power that must be consumed to charge up and sustain the charge.

4. Due to the gravity well limitation, ships that have completed transit must continue their journey via realspace to their destinations. Depending on how far they are from the new host body, inbound transit could take the better part of a month for destinations very far within a gravity well. Outbound transit is the same.",CyriousLordofDerp,2020-03-04,Ireland

GAA AND PE OR Physical Education OR Teacher OR Sports Science,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/fcqxzx/discussion_fasterthanlight_travel/,Discussion: faster-than-light travel,"ditOh yeah, there's one from a mass effect fanfic I found rather interesting, albeit overpowered as fuck.

It was what was described as a temporal slingshot drive. How it worked was that it on activation, transited the ship BACK in time to a period earlier in the universe, typically a microsecond or two after the big-bang, generally when the universe was much smaller. Now, the universe doesn't like this, and it snaps the time-transiting object back to its normal time after a tiny delay (order of milliseconds). However, during that brief time period back in time, the ship can still move. When the snapback occurs, it snaps the ship to the same realspace location it had back in time before the snapback.

So, think of it this way:

1. Ship initates transit at point A, destination Betelgeuse (point B). Distance is about 700ly away from Earth.

2. Back in time, point A is only 7mm away from point B because the universal expansion between those two points hasn't occurred yet. During this time the ship moves from point A to point B under computer control

3. Universe snaps the ship back forwards in time to its proper timeframe, but the location is now at point B.

4. Ship completes transit, completing a 700ly journey in milliseconds.

One of the characters in the fanfic used this drive and about 70 jumps to make a round trip to Andromeda and back essentially within a day. The underlying physics of this drive also has, if left unshielded, a tendency to cause Eezo to explode with an energy density that makes matter-antimatter look like dynamite.

Discussion: faster-than-light travel,"Technically not FTL, and technically similar to Alcubierre drives/""stutter warp"", there is a principle in the Independence War series of games called ""Linear Displacement"".  
  
Used as a single device, the Linear Displacement System (LDS) allows extremely rapid movement in the ship's ""forward"" direction by moving - ""displacing"" - the whole thing in small instantaneous bursts of distance, the most powerful ones approaching lightspeed. In the game itself however, even the weakest LDS drives go faster than lightspeed due to a lack of ""time acceleration"" features.  
LDS drives are sensitive to gravity wells, and will fail when trying to displace through too steep a gravity gradient. Certain patterns of electromagnetic emissions interfere with them as well, utilized by large stations to enforce a safe area around them, and in special ""LDS Inhibitor"" missiles used by law enforcement and pirates.  
  
Linear Displacement can also be used in arrays of smaller emitters, creating an ""LDA Shield"" - an active defense system that uses the onboard computer to track sources of incoming threats - i.e. hostile ships and imminent collisions - and attempts to repel and disperse various bolts of superheated plasma and solid objects near the ship by violently shunting them in different directions simultaneously. Notably vulnerable to lasers - for obvious reasons, as well as antimatter (a dispersed chunk of antimatter is still antimatter, it just hits a large area instead of all in one place), and multiple threats incoming from a single facing, as the array can't switch targets too quickly (a matter addressed in larger ships by simply mounting multiple arrays per ship facing).

This will be entirely dependent on Jane, since no other being possesses the ample mental capacity to hold the complete structure of an object in its mind.

Jane's test flight consists of a sealed box with a door, Ender (to whom Jane is inextricably philotically linked; indeed, her aiúa resides within him), Miro (for the same reason), and Ela (so that she can create the recolada virus once they are Outside). While Outside, Ela creates the recolada virus, Miro recreates his healthy body and possesses it, and Ender unconsciously creates duplicates of his childhood brother and sister.”

Basically an Ansible based AI ‘thinks’ you out of the universe where your imagination becomes reality, and then ‘thinks’ you back in at any other point.",its2ez4me24get,2020-03-06,Ireland

The stipulations outlined in the document you link to are riddled with explanations why you aren't.  A couple possible reasons why:

>4. Only courses taken at GCC are covered by this agreement. Credit awarded by GCC for AP, CLEP, IB, or any other sources based on work not completed at GCC, including credit by internal exams will be reevaluated by Mason.  Credit is not guaranteed for these sources, and will be reviewed for credit consistency with Mason standards.  GCC applicants who meet minimum score requirements for AP, CLEP or IB credit at Mason are required to provide the Office of Admissions an official transcript from the testing agency at time of application.

Under ""Exclusions to the Guaranteed Admissions Agreement"" (in big bold letters)
>NOTE: Certain degree programs within the College of Education and Human Development, the College of Visual and Performing Arts, the School of Management, the School of Nursing, and the Volgenau School of Engineering have additional requirements for admission.  Meeting the minimum terms of this agreement does not guarantee admission to those degree programs.  Specific prerequisite courses, higher minimum grades, and a higher GPA may be required.  

And if I'm reading your post correctly, the changes initiated took place *before* you finalized your application to transfer.  It doesn't matter if it was a month, a week, or even a day- you aren't grandfathered in because the standards that apply to you aren't applicable anymore.  It sucks, but you're at the mercy of the guidelines if they're clearly stipulated- which they seem to be.

And I'd like to add that calling this a ""scandal"" is both hyperbole and sensationalist in nature.  It's one thing if you upheld your end of a contract and the other party did not fulfill theirs.  While you may feel jobbed because you got stuck in between changes, they don't owe you anything, *nor are you entitled to anything.*  

""Future students"" will not be ""suffering"" from anything unheard of.  The contract changes, if they indeed took place (and I have no reference point, other than your posted anecdote of what took place), are clearly outlined.

I know it's a tough pill to swallow.  Believe me.  I'm finishing my last two classes and have paid for them out of pocket.  They're expensive.  But take solace in the fact that transferring from CC allowed you to save a bundle.  That's all the comfort I can offer.  

Other than that, you've got to put your big-boy pants on and understand that it's the nature of any large-scale organization to necessitate changes which are beneficial for the masses, but will undoubtedly affect a few in a negative way- you, in this case, fall into that category.  You can raise a stink, but, in the end, you're not in the right.

I've sat in a couple of the meetings given by the COS, where future directions, budgetary concerns, and the like are discussed (incidentally, many of these are open to students who wish to attend).  I remember distinctly hearing Dean Chandhoke discussing the necessity to add certain fees to certain classes to meet bottom-lines; not necessarily to reap oodles of scrilla, simply because it had to be done to sustain the college writ large.  I'm not positive, but I'm willing to bet that this is the same type of conclusion that was made when initiating this change.  Don't take it as a personal affront.

That said, I'm not sure who I would bump to move them up.

**Edit**:  Also while I'm here I'll mention that I wish fewer rankers would use a model that relies so heavily on a team's record from the last week. I understand why they do it, to try to reflect which teams have been playing the best lately, but I think it skews things way too much to the point where these rankings have really no chance of representing a real best-to-worst ranking of the teams in the league.

Like, it is fantastic that Columbus is playing so well lately.  They're exceeding everyone's expectations in a really spectacular way, and establishing themselves as a dominant and competitive squad.

But personally, I think that if I'm looking at any random match-up in the league, I should be able to look at the power rankings and get a decent idea of who is more likely to win.

Do we really think that Columbus would roll into Pittsburgh right now and we should expect them to come out on top?  I don't know about that.

Anyway, I think the rankers who work solely off of what happened in the last week should re-evaluate their criteria, because I think it's making for some kind of stupid rankings.

I go by weekly success. After all, if you wanted an overall look of a team so far, you'd check the standings, not a weekly ranking.


My order is Win%, total wins, GD, total goals scored, Standings. So if Vancouver played 3 games this week and won all 3, then they'd have 100% win%, and have a good shot at the top of my rankings.

It does not mean the customer is actually always right and you should always do or listen to what they say.

It means the customer may actually have a point and you should look into the issue be it whats causing their problem or whats happened.  You should listen to them, Acknowledge the problem and see how you can fix it.

Saying "" I ordered this burger double cheeseburger but it has to much cheese in it"" doesnt mean the customer is right, it has too much cheese in it and you should change the burger from now on, It means The customer isnt happy with it and they are right, it has too much cheese for them, advise them thats the standard amount of cheese and offer them an alternative.""  


The customer in this situation is made to feel like they were right to complain, and you can solve their issue if you like, You dont change the product overall just becuase they said to.

Saying ""Increase the loot, you dont get enough"", Does not mean they should just increase the loot, They have already said they are looking at the loot  so they have already acknowledged the issue.  They cant just up the loot becuase

There seem to be a lot of negative unintended consequences in the game and I think it’s possible that they can’t figure out how to increase the drop rate on certain activities without opening the floodgates game-wide.

I was working as a self-taught Cold Fusion (*gag*) web developer back in 2000 while putting myself through school. I majored in physical anthropology instead of CS, which gave me way more practical tools for everyday use: learning on my own, writing technical emails/reports, understanding problems holistically instead of just working to an exact spec, task/time management, working as part of a team, etc. The best developers and sysadmins I've met all had humanity/social sciences degrees, if anything, which just seems to corroborate my experience but I'm sure it's part bias.

How do you view the role of a CS degree now and in the future (i.e. the big trade school or theoretical knowledge debate)? What would you improve in a traditional CS program? Where do you see self-taught people in web development struggle more than those with a relevant degree?

This means goin' on a solid classic rant because of this, I wouldn't even *be* the Plow if I didn't and I'm namin' names and goin' overboard. Thanks Mordor, bang-up job, valkkommen to the team but they're all little blond boys who won't even fight.

Now this is ""Kyle, Palm-i-eri"" we're talking about. Just a no-name, hockey nobody. The hockey world thinks he's a victim of blockerpunches, neglects the skateblade to the goalie's pad right before it. He's a turtler, a weasel, a rat aboard the ship, exactly the rat we warned you would happen if you took fighting out, and this guy should be *easy* to fight. He can't play hockey like that and not fight, no one can.  

Can forgive the 2nd period maybe, but by the 3rd period, everyone shoulda known Brodin was out by then and came out flying/mad and only one guy (Folin), did. So let's start with the leadership.

**Staal.** We've seen you fight, after your brother Jordan took a dirty hit late, we watched you take Phaneuf and rifle a silly slapper right by him for the ENG, it was awesome. Is Bro-din not your brother yet? Do you wanna earn a letter, or just get one with your contract like the other 3? Coulda just dummied him, but I guess you could be the best hockey player in the world if you looked after your whole team like they were your younger bro.

**Koivu.** So, you're a captain but you don't fight, it's beneath you, too savage, uncivilized. Un-european. Part of that C means sticking up for teammates and can you at least throw a hit now and then, or are those shoulders just for sweater modelling. If sticking up for your teammates is beneath you, then that C's above you and it's just for show, I guess it stands for ""Coddle Koivu"", wake up. You're the captain of this team, you should know how important Jonas Brodin is to the team. Don't just *do* something, *stand* there.

**Suter.** You're a pretty big kid, but are ya really, if everyone knows you won't fight? The word's out, ""he wouldn't hurt a fly"", no wonder they're buggin' ya. Your uncle Gary was dirty, why can't you fight, if you can play dirty? That kid was your defensive partner for how long and you can't fight for him? Why was Abdelkader humpin' your leg for 20 seconds last year? Oh, right, Team USA, you know that guy so he's good shit. He's not ""good shit"", he's a douchebag playin' hockey *against* you.

**Parise.** The way Team USA boys sometimes play buddy-buddy with each other when they're on opposing teams is just gross. It's league-wide country club preppy bullshit. You wanna know the secret, you wanna know what Team Canada has that Team USA doesn't? Toewser'll fight Benn who'll fight Jumbo who'll fight Weber who'll fight Keith who'll fight Burnsy who'll fight Sid and everyone from the top-down and the bottom-up will just drop 'em in the NHL for fun. Are they a little nuts? Oh fuck yeah bud, but you gotta be, hockey's crazy. It shouldn't matter if Palmieri's some USAbro from some fratboy joke team. He just injured *your team*'s best defenceman. Friendly reminder that you're wearing a letter, so find some grit and fuckin' use it.  

**Dubnyk.** Would you throw blockerpunches for a teammate? Honest question. Any of these leaguewide losers put their skates into your goal pads, well, your legs are this entire $70M team bud and they know that when they put their skates into them, they know that's our entire fanbases' hopes right and maybe your blocker's our only insurance policy. Shame that a goalie should have to fight, and his D-men won't but Harding had to: this softness thing goes back a ways.

**Pominville.** Well I'd put you in the same category as Niederreiter, from Switzerland and neutral/exempt, but you've worn a letter before too and this means lead by example. Make up your mind whether you're from Quebec or the States or if you wanna miss the net or hit the net, but make a decision you waffly spectator. No one's expecting a fight or a goal out of you, but a decision one way or the other would be nice. Go score a goal, you were shootin' fuckin' hard in the second, you hit Staal with a sick pass that he didn't even expect could get through and he missed: keep playin' like that.

**Onto The Kids**:  
**Coyle** (Bruins fan, no? Maybe more of a Sergei Samsonov fan were ya? You should be [more like Cam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXP3qu7n5M8) and a little less like Vladimir Ruzicka by now eh)  
**Zucker** (trainin' to be a cage fighter? Or now that you're in, you just don't need fighting on your resume anymore?)  
**Haula** (a ""pest"", but not a fighter? How are you any better than Palmieri?)  
but especially **Matt Dumba**. Isn't Brodin your roommate, BFF, don't you kids *like* Jonas Brodin? You can fight under the limelight on NYE against Columbus, but not for a good reason? What'd he do, wheel all your exes, what's your possible excuse here Superchiefs? Takin' a page from The Vets and tryin' to hit 'em on the scoreboard, thinkin' that fighting for the team will take away from ""your"" game? Thinkin' me first? Fuck that, stick up for each other boys.  

**Boudreau**: why'd you bring Stewart with ya. 'Cause we were supersoft, right, that was our weakness? You're right, we were, but: Chris Stewart is just a goal-scorer now? Why not both?

**C-Stew**: Your hands are silky mittens now, they just can't be insured now 'cause you're such a top-shelf goal-scorer? It was your job to fight Palmieri and if you woulda, well he doesn't tie the game up if he's in the box with ya.  

**Christian Folin:** fuckin' great game, what a beauty, Sheriff hat in my book and it didn't go unnoticed that you dialled in Severson, blew him up and we scored what shoulda been the GWG right after. You gave Palmieri a good shot but next time give him a good shot and then drop 'em, you were the only one playing like you got Brodin's injury report. Gained a lot of respect for ya last night and lost a little for most everyone else, except Spurge and Dubnyk.

Anyway I think that was some pretty good chirpin' but now the scouting report's out on how to beat teams like Russia, USA and the Minnesota Wild. Just hit them and watch them beat themselves up for the rest of the game. I don't blame Palmieri or New Jersey or their coach for playing like that against us at all, I would too if coachin' against the Wild: it was the lack of a response, plus not having Brodin playing, that lost us the game.  

See what happened to the Habs when they tried to hit 'em back on the scoreboard, after Carey Price got taken out? It doesn't work, Gordon Bombay was a terrible coach. Sink down to their level, punch 'em in the head, *then* go score.

We got a quote before the game from Dubnyk: *""We're confident that we can win every way we need to"".* Well, nope, not every way: this gritty parking-lot-hockey with the cheap stuff is the type of game we'll have to learn to win, somehow. Even if we'd held on for the win, this was like a repeat performance of the game when Brodin got injured in New York, just on home ice this time.

Now they're comin', they know to get Filthy McGrease now 'cause you guys didn't do anything the first 3 times. Maybe not Arizona next, but teams'll know this in the playoffs: Benn knew he could glove-slap Parise and nothing would happen, so did Torey Krug earlier in the season. No one wants to stick up for their captains? K well, heads' up, they're comin'. So it'd be some good preparation now to think about what you're gonna do when that kind of bullshit goes down again. Kuemper would be the least of our worries if that's how they respond in the playoffs.",[deleted],2017-01-18,Ireland

GAA AND PE OR Physical Education OR Teacher OR Sports Science,https://www.reddit.com/r/materials/comments/84afhz/why_do_we_care_about_diffusion/,Why do we care about diffusion?,"Hoboy, diffusion is super important in semiconductors. Example:  GaAs solar cells are typically made by depositing at least two layers of material, one with a p type and one with an n type dopant. If you are developing a new process, you need to be able to estimate the diffusion rate of those dopants and how it changes with tenperature, so you can figure out how hot you can run the deposition (an abrupt doping profile is better for efficiency). Zn, for instance diffuses much faster in GaAs than Te, so that suggests you should make your Zn doped layer a lower concentration and run it at a lower temperature. That lower tenperature might not be ideal for electronic properties, but that gives you an idea of the complexity of designing a semiconductor device.


Understanding diffusion is also critical for understanding film depositon from the gas phase, and it describes electron motion--you can calculate the current from the electrict potential (drift) plus chemical potential aka the electron concentration gradient (diffusion). 


You can of course find huge reports written about ""diffusion in GaAs"" but they will basically be collations of journal articles on the diffusion rates of various elements and how to model them vs temperature, etc. More interesting is how we use that data and that generally comes down to making different types of semiconductor devices and trying to calculate dopant or detrimental impurity concentrations as a function of position within the device, because impurities and defects determine how devices behave

Basically to make a diode, you have a piece of n doped semiconductor (rich in electrons) next to a piece of p doped semiconductor (rich in holes, which are basically just a positively charged space where there isn't an electron but can be treated as a positive particle). 

Due to the presence of a concentration difference between the two, the electrons diffuse into the p doped region and the holes diffuse into the n doped region. But, since these particles are charged, eventually the electric field created by the movement of the electrons and holes prevents further diffusion.

My grades at NOVA were good, maybe had a 3.2.

I would recommend talking with both the NOVA and GMU counselors. I feel like GMU is always changing which classes they accept, so you wanna make sure the ones you take will transfer and work with your engineering degree requirements.

There's also this transfer orientation at GMU you can go to once you've been accepted that goes over everything, I highly recommend attending when you get accepted.",sianayat,2018-08-23,Ireland

GAA AND PE OR Physical Education OR Teacher OR Sports Science,http://www.sciencemag.org/content/350/6256/68,IBM Scientists Find New Way to Shrink Transistors,"I am reposting this comment from the /r/technews subreddit. This is my opinion, but it is also the (heavily paraphrased and summarized) opinion of some rather prominent people in transistor design.

The caveat, of course, is that you may think they are naturally resistant to non-silicon transistors.

I would post the actual lecture(s) I base this on, but they are unfortunately proprietary. For that reason as well, I won't make direct quotes or citations. Nor can I check that what I've written is 100% accurate because I no longer have access to the lectures...

---

Carbon nanotubes will not be used as transistors in mass production.

Interestingly, traditional scaling ended around 90nm. We have had several generations of new ways of shrinking transistors. Strain, high-K, finfet. Since 90nm, we've had 65nm, 45nm, 32nm, 22nm, and 14nm (though other fabs use different numbers for their nodes, it's still been five nodes; of course I refer to digital, not analog, and I refer to logic, not storage.)

Today we use finfets (trifets from intel) at the leading node.
IMO, the next big change will be GAA (gate-all-around) transistors. An extremely simplified way of thinking of them is this: think of a copper wire; the insulation outside of it is the gate, and the copper is the channel (drain-source). Gate all around.

If I'm right, after that will be multiple GAA in parallel (think of four smaller copper wires in parallel).

After that, I have no idea, but I'd guess T (tunneling) FETs.
Here's the problem with carbon nanotubes: short-channel effects. It's been a while since I've looked into this, so my explanation could be wrong. Again, this is extremely simplified.

You want to be able to do two things: have very good on-control and off-control. In other words, you don't want leakage when the transistor is off, but you also want to very easily be able to turn it on, and when it's on, you want low (as close to zero as possible) resistance. You also want to be able to use a low gate-source voltage in order to turn the transistor on. All of these things add up to very little power drain (and therefore heat.)

There is a trade-off between being able to use a small Vgs and have a good ability to turn the transistor off.

Carbon nanotubes in practice do not do very well at this. They may be theorized to do better, but as time goes on, we figure out how to make silicon behave better as well. The end result, in my opinion, is that there will never (or not for a very long time) be enough R&D investment into carbon nanotubes to reach a point where they have better characteristics than silicon transistors have at the same point in time. Remember, silicon transistors see tens of billions of dollars of investment a year: research and development of the transistors, research and development of the tools used to build the transistors, creation of factories to manufacture them in absolutely massive quantity, and of course, chips that are designed with them. There is no such financial incentive for carbon nanotubes.

I think that by the time they get anywhere near good enough to compete with silicon state-of-the-art, if they ever do, we will by that point have transitioned to something else that's even better, and much more closely related to today's silicon (you know, so we can keep the knowledge of tools, fabs, and design.) For example, maybe carbon nanotubes will be just as useful as multiple GAA, but if we've moved on to TFETs by then... you see?

Also, carbon nanotubes are a little bit of a ""wonder drug"" that people like to think is going to be incredibly useful, but nobody knows exactly how useful... in other words, hype. I think in this case, over-hype.",gimpwiz,2015-10-02,Ireland

If you end up in a position where you change your mind and you can't/don't want to go to law school, you'll be stuck with unemployable degrees. Given your lack of a safety net, I would recommend you pick an undergraduate degree that can function standalone in-case you don't want to pursue law school. 

While it's good that you are trying to create a game plan, you should be careful of hinging them on many ""if's"". It's much easier said than done, and you'll likely encounter bumps or obstacles that you didn't when you were planning things in your head.
