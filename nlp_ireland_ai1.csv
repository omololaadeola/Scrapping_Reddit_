>These coordinators manage courses, but in many cases low-paid casuals – working as little as five hours a week – answer student emails and respond to online discussion boards.

>“I have a [work] email and I also have a university email, even though I’m not employed by the university. I can only use [the university] email with students,” the whistleblower said.

> “You feel like you’re fooling [the students] because I’m not allowed to mention [the company]. As far as the students are concerned there’s no [company].

The exam I took for it was not relevant to the material in class. Once the exam was done we got a group of students to come together and email and complain to the course coordinater.  I am sure nothing has changed, especially after the cuts from the pandemic.

There have been no issues AFTER I was hired, but I’ll be honest and say that I have always taken out my jewelry for job interviews. I have 10 piercings in my ears (including 00g lobes), and a philtrum piercing, and pierced nipples, as well as my arms (and back) covered in tattoos (and I’m a guy, by the way- we tend to get judged for piercings a little more than women do). But yeah- for job interviews I remove all the jewelry from ears and wear flesh-colored silicone hider plugs in my lobes (besides wearing a long-sleeve shirt to cover my arms). Even though I obviously love body art and modifications, I am definitely aware that not everyone else does. I personally recommend that anyone aiming to enter a potentially conservative profession not get any modification that can’t be removed or easily hidden with normal clothing. This is the main reason I have never gotten a tattoo anywhere above chest level and below wrist level (even though I like the look of neck tattoos, I wouldn’t want to have to suspiciously wear a scarf to a job interview in Summer).

It seems like you are trying to studying three areas simultaneously to significant depth. There will be several students doing any two of these subjects together, but three is quite a lot. Probably after your first year you will better understand your interests and revise your plans. 

It should be possible to choose your first year courses to keep all your options open in each subject. Over the course of your first year, you will probably figure out what you want to focus on, and you can then plan you subsequent years. The main thing to keep in mind is that, compared to your future self a year or two from now, chances are good that you have no idea what you want to do! This is exciting! 

As for courses: 

The course MAT 347 is foundational, and you should not make plans now that will force you not to take it. I’d be surprised if it wasn’t a requirement. The course 454 is also quite central mainstream mathematics. The other courses you list are very specialized topics courses. You have no way of knowing if you will be interested in them until you have several years more math education, and they need not be offered every year. Which topics courses will be offered next year hasn’t even been decided yet in most departments.

So even for a pure math specialist, there's more mandatory math stuff (e.g. 347), but in your last year(s), you can't get an overview of everything: most people will either focus on algebra, analysis, diff geo, etc.

Similarly in math/phys, most people will take the math courses they think they'll need based on their interests, and will take some of the higher level math courses earlier (e.g. if you're confident, 367 is possible to do in second year).

I have a BS in physical education, and have my initial certificate for PE.","Where is NY are you from? I graduated in 2017 with my MA in PE and landed a lead teaching position in the Bronx for the DOE. Its not ideal teaching in the city and comes with many challenges however if your looking for a full time job, great salary and benefits they have many PE openings, however they are usually in high needs neighborhoods like the one I'm in. I personally don't recommend working for a catholic, private, or charter school if your goal is to teach public school. In lower NY many school districts won't look at that experience as applicable since catholic, private and charter schools are all run very different. 


My wife is a 2nd grade classroom teacher and got a job at a private school right out of grad school. She loves where she works but salary and benefits are much less than mine even though we have the same years experience  teaching. Also recently we have both been applying for jobs at top public schools in Westchester County and I have been getting many more interviews and demo lessons while she has struggled to even get an initial phone screening. 

One thing I believe is really important to think about is where you want your future to go and plan for that. I have always wanted to become an athletic director and head of PE at a public school. Therefore I set out to gain experience at a public school in the city, coach each season at different High schools in the area to build a reputation amongst school admin.",coachwoodcock,2021-02-16,Ireland

Though I did curriculum work for stipends many summers and sort of worked (usually from home, though sometimes I had to travel or go in—I never took a real second job or taught summer school, no interaction work) then too. I do work, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t miss summer because I get way less interaction to drain me. I’m an introvert though so that was always a struggle with teaching and even work before teaching. Now that I know that, especially since the pandemic, and now that I can find and keep remote work (my field has lots still), I’m so much happier. It is very different to individuals though I’m sure. If you love summer off with your kids or something, you might miss it.

(I also get plenty of vacation time but honestly I don’t even need it. I’m not sure I’d love any crappy terrible in office 5 days a week no flexibility 2 weeks vacation a year garbage job.

My thought is that if this is on school devices, then 30 or so licenses are a reusable investment, especially if you buy the licenses in a sale, which I assume will be more likely as the KSP2 release date approaches...

Another thought:  can you install 30instances of KSP on a school drive somewhere that the students can access via their own devices when the need to build stuff in KSP?  That approach has some challenges and may be a terrible idea ... but perhaps someone in your IT team can figure a solution.

In intro philosophy and logic classes, we learn a bit about a technique called ""argument mapping"" - the construction of a sort of flow chart that visualizes lines of logical support between premises and conclusions. It can be used for both preparing and evaluating argumentative writing, and has been [empirically validated](https://thinkeranalytix.org/methods/) as a pretty useful tool for thinking and argumentation. It seems to me that argument mapping could serve as a useful substitute for writing when it comes to practicing critical thinking. I have 3 questions:

1) Do AI text generation tools pose a threat to argumentative writing that's presented graphically (eg. as an argument map) rather than as prose?

2) If not, do you think argument mapping could subvert the ChatGPT issue for argumentative writing (a major subset of the kind of writing expected at the college level)?

3) Is anyone talking about argument mapping (or other forms of non-prose writing) as potential solutions to the ChatGPT problem?

I’m a producer in film/ TV. As a test, we inputted a basic logline for a feature film we’re producing for a well established studio that is just a pitch at the moment. Incredibly, ChatGPT produced the best pitch based on a two sentence logline than about 90% of the most expensive writers in the business. This included well orchestrated characters and descriptions, beats, and even jokes based on the specific content that were actually funny. For years, we assumed AI could never replace a creative field. 

Collectively, we worried not only for writers in the business, but executives across the board. A plausible future could be “screenplay by Netflix”, with maybe a hired executive or writer for all small touch ups. 

There are upcoming negotiations between the WGA and the studios. While the guilds have decided not to include AI in these contracts, with the advancements just within the past month, there is an argument for this possibly being the most important element to include. 

Do you believe within the next few years, it could be a possibility that if implementations aren’t in place now, we could see creative businesses dependent on AI? If so, are there solutions used to potentially get ahead of this? Thank you.",zachbook,2023-02-27,Ireland

I could see this creating some legal trouble, especially if someone generates the actual content that is intended to be sold (like the chapter of a book). 

Generative AI already has some legal and ethical issues now in the Open Source community in the form of Github Copilot. If you're unfamiliar, the tool is like a souped-up version of autocomplete for programmers. The issue here is that it was trained on open source code, but much of that code was licensed under one of the GPL or other licenses which say that the code is free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute in any way, but whatever is produced must also be free to use in the same vein.

They argue that their IP forms a kind of digital DNA or essence that goes into the output of these tools, and that it is lessened in some way.

Do you think there is merit in this line of thinking, and if so, how does it apply to text-generating AI, such as ChatGPT? Are great works of fiction lessened by an automated tool that can trivially generate the great American novel?

Do you see a potential positive regarding AI generated text that most people seem to miss?

I would love to hear your opinion on a different aspect of AI text generation in education, which is about personalized learning.

Many perceive the ability to personalize the learning experience according to each student's needs as being one of the holy grails in education. It's also obvious that no matter how skilled and dedicated a teacher or professor is, such a customization can not be handled by a single person.

What are the ethical implications of using AI to generate courses or support materials that are different for every student?

I have yet to see a quality AI released without overzealous sexual content filters, regardless of the heavy demand for such a product. The first person to release such a thing is looking at a big payday.

[Character.AI](https://Character.AI) is an entertainment chatbot website that allows you to do ANYTHING with their AI... anything but simulated sex or sexual contexts. They have been banning anyone attempting to discuss the topic for months, and the people running the site have gone quiet after public outrage against their content filters (which are all but proven to reduce the quality of AI responses, similar to how stable diffusion 2.0 has inferior generation capabilities after the removal of sexual content from their dataset). The CharacterAI NSFW subreddit has 1/2 the users of the official subreddit, and was made as a response to the ban of all discussion involving adult content (you can search for it yourself if you wish).

OpenAI has stated that they will not allow pornographic content to be generated. This includes creative works such as erotica (and they do not allow others to provide this service either, the only exception I'm aware of being Sudowrite).

Replika has recently taken a huge blow after spontaneously deciding to remove the ability for users to engage in erotic conversations with their model. Possibly due to trying to use OpenAI's tech to improve their models conversational abilities?

&#x200B;

The lack of explanation from the AI ""ethics"" community on this topic has been extremely disheartening to see.  Is a company choosing not to heavily restrict the user's ability to engage in sexual conversations with the AI really such a crime against humanity?

I'm confident that many have already come to the same condition, but in case we haven't, I'm writing you as a reminder, that we require preventive laws for Ai content generation, to avoid deviant content from being generated as some individuals will not restrain them self from experiencing this degenerate experiences in real life.
We absolutely cannot wait or expect the companies involved in this future industry to behave as many of them have already proven in the past of not being trustworthy.

When you are a teenager, education isn’t focused only on academics. That comes later on, in college or university, when you choose the scope of your education.

It’s hard to put into words. In Denmark, we call it ‘almen dannelse’, which directly translates to general education, but it really means that your education is focused on molding you into becoming a better citizen. You are taught math, poetry, history, philosophy, literature, English, Latin, French, German, music, and most importantly for this post: sport.

You don’t need any of these things in your everyday life, but you do need these things to be *educated*. It is also very beneficial for your learning and health. Most teenagers need to exercise more, especially in America where some are fucking round.

Also: ‘Jocks picking on nerds’?! Are you from an 80’s movie? Academics and fitness aren’t mutually exclusive. To me it sounds like you hate sports because you were bullied there, which sucks but there’s nothing to be done.

I have a little notepad that I wrote down my thoughts in as I read  
(I will paste it directly below at the end of this comment)

Now that we know more about the curriculum we can expect and the community service, I wish to form a hypothesis  


Emma is going to kill a dragon (like come on, the bait is right there) and I cant wait to see how  
(Considering human firearms compared to medieval weaponry, likely a well placed shot through VATS).

The rich get an easy life and get to coast through the community service. im guessing Emma is going to see a ""poor"" student try to take a clerical job and get denied, then Emma is going to call BULLSHIT on that. Might not happen but who knows.

I am a bit disappointed about to firearm stuff, but I know that going to fast would ruin a good book so I will be patient (if only I could time travel...)

The class on mana detection or whatever it was, will be very useful for Emma because it may allow her to mod the suit to detect the magical apparitions.

I am sad that she cant eat the food, but I am glad to see the reference to the stomach port from Terminal alliance (Janitors of the Post Apocalypse).  


All in all, amazing work OP, and I cant wait till next Sunday.

An investigation found that while the training didn’t explicitly contain content that broke the law, the school was still penalized and had its accreditation downgraded because the state school board felt that the training could still convey outlawed ideas.

>“Upon reviewing this information, the OSDE did not find any evidence to substantiate the allegation that the training included ‘statements that specifically shame white people for past offenses in history, and state that all are implicitly racially biased in nature,’” Clark wrote.   
>  
>However, the investigation did find that audio from the training, which Clark later declined to provide the the State Board of Education, “incorporated” or was “based on” concepts including that “societal systems, including public schools, were originally solely developed by the majority, who were then predominantly White, middle-class individuals,” that black students are more likely to be suspended than white students, and that “deeply rooted stereotypes, built over time and by history and culture, can still be found in classrooms.”  
>  
>These ideas violated House Bill 1775, a law Oklahoma enacted in 2021 that banned some teachings about race and gender in public schools, even if the concepts weren’t explicitly mentioned, Clark wrote.   
>  
>“Though there were not direct statements in the training that an individual should feel discomfort or guilt because of their race, the design and basis of the training makes it more likely than not that it incorporates and/or is based on such a concept,” the letter said.   
>  
>The state board voted last week 4-2 to downgrade both Tulsa and Mustang Public Schools to “accredited with a warning,” a harsher punishment than was originally recommended. Mustang Public Schools, which self-reported a violation from earlier this year based on a student exercise meant to increase empathy among students, received the same punishment as Tulsa for the sake of consistency, board members said last week. There is no appeals process.    
>  
>“There was no violation of 1775 in the complete 18-minute audio and video that I saw and heard,” said Goodwin. “Clark admitted there was no violation in the materials. He spoke to his interpretation of what the materials possibly could mean and of what he thought the vendor intended. In what world is that a credible violation of law?”  
>  
>But Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, a co-author of HB1775, said he thinks Clark’s conclusion is fair and that violations of HB1775 don’t need to be explicit. “When a seminar talking about ‘racial bias’ is telling you that black people are more likely to be suspended than white people, I don’t know that it’s like crazy to think that somebody is going to think that you’re trying to get me to realize that (white teachers who disproportionately suspend black students) are racist,” he said.  
>  
>“To me, if you drop breadcrumbs towards a specific conclusion, I don’t think that you get a pass just because you didn’t explicitly state the final conclusion,” Caldwell said. Rep. Kevin West, R-Moore, the principal author of HB1775, agreed.

I think it’s pretty sensible to ban teachings that tell people they should feel guilty, or ascribe blame to them for historical wrongs. However, I personally think Rep. Caldwell’s comments are very concerning. I think it’s very dangerous to ban facts that could induce guilt or imply the existence of structural racism without stating it outright.

20 year veteran teacher. Our profession is under attack on all sides and we are beyond under appreciated. Facts. 

But my two saving graces/sage teaching tips are these:
1) Build relationships with your students. All of them. If you teach secondary (I teach 8th) it might take MONTHS to do this , but keep at it. This is done through clear expectations, procedures and structure from day one.  And being consistent when they don’t meet those expectations. 

They will walk through a wall for you if you do so. Even the toughest ones from a title one school…they are kids and just need to know you care about them, especially when they mess up. It really is that simple. 

2) Leave school at school. Meaning don’t grade or plan outside of school. You CAN do this. Not everything needs to be graded, as it is often a skill being taught and then practiced. Being a great teacher does not require you to sacrifice yourself in the process. The world will keep spinning if something doesn’t get done. Cut yourself some slack. 

Today was a hurricane make-up day for us. The Friday before spring break. Half of my kiddos were there. I used it as an opportunity to build relationships. I introduced them to the joy that is the Oregon Trail computer game. Yes that one from the 80s that required an actual floppy disk to play back in the day. We had a blast. Tech immersed 8th graders weren’t even bored navigating it. Today was a good day….

If you no longer feel joy for teaching, then by all means move on. But for those that are struggling and haven’t trash or treasure my advice.",Embarrassed_Humor68,2023-03-11,Ireland

Then, add your flunkey, super-ambitious administrators to the mix, who know nothing about teaching but are experts in harassment and inducing stress.

Teaching AND Holidays OR Summer OR PE OR Course OR Physical Education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/11fdk1o/do_not_go_into_teaching_until_society_gets_its/,"Do not go into teaching until society gets its act together - Too dangerous, both physically and mentally","I have a thought. I agree with the assessment of the challenges teachers face in the profession. There are ways to adapt, though. 

For example, classroom management skills can be taught better in education programs. It seems it was an area I struggled with early in my experience until I realized that content isn’t the only thing we teach. We establish clear standards and reinforce this in every class. Now I use content to teach the academic skills instead of assuming academic skills will come on their own. If I get through the entire content of my lesson, it means academic skills are in place and I can do more. 

Another example is the huge priority administration is putting on testing and data. I appreciate the stress that administrators are under. There’s a lot of data-based reform happening (not a terrible thing), but it’s not like teachers are going to benefit from stressing about it. So keep the data in mind, but focus on your teachers and support them as much as you’re asking teachers to support students. Administrators have a lot of work I would never want to deal with myself, so I’m grateful to have supportive administrators who are looking for opportunities to support staff. There’s no way I would be interested in finding a new job if the administrators are supportive. I have amazing ones. I interview administrators if they’re interested in hiring me. I don’t have any interest in working for anyone who prioritizes data over supporting the work I do for their students. 

And if we’re looking at students today compared to students pre-internet, sure, they’re overstimulated more than those of us who remember what life was like before the internet existed. Distractions existed though. We weren’t much better as children at being focused and engaged in every lesson. Our teachers were professionals (the ones we remember, at least). They were kind. They showed that they cared about us. They made us feel loved and cared for. Then they went home, and maybe while out shopping at a local grocery store, we’d see them… and gasp! A TEACHER in the natural world doing what everyday people do. 

I get hugs almost every day from my elementary kids. My middle school 5-8 band is playing so well that I’m bragging about them to everyone. I show them each respect and praise their efforts. I model the behavior I expect of them. I’m not just modeling it for myself, so I have an easier time teaching. Yeah, that’s a benefit of teaching professional skills, but their professionalism is transferable to nearly any career they can imagine. 

Young people thrive on being respected like adults. It’s their intrinsic motivation to be better when their teacher shows them the respect they otherwise never receive as children. It’s special. Even my youngest students are buying into being respected and learning how respect is earned through effort. In a classroom where the focus is on the academic and professional skillset of each and every student, you can teach any content in any subject. They’re not kids in school. Our students are young adults training to become adults. 

And if we remember that, no matter what challenges we face in education, building strong and professional relationships (and explaining our roles, reinforcing our expectations with KINDNESS, EMPATHY, compassion, and all of the things we’ve probably heard in sessions of PD in the afternoon when we’ve been teaching all day and just need a cocktail to decompress.. IYKYK), teachers really do make the difference. We don’t do it with content. We do it by modeling ourselves as the adults we hope our students will one day grow up to become.

That said, the fact that even the most well-meaning of parents have failed to raise well-behaved teenagers partially vindicates OP's point. Modern society has failed parents. It's given them few means to uphold proper upbringing, and probably not much better in the field of parenting advice.

&#x200B;

As well, teenagers are held to lower standards of respectfulness; by parents, teaching colleagues, and administrators alike; than other adults are by colleagues or even the leaders of the most informal of social clubs.

It can be frustrating when you feel like you're working with kids who don't respect you and aren't being held accountable by your community. Education as an institution has issues with resistance from the community because historically it is a tool of imperial oppression. We can see this in the cultural genocide of native Americans and in the struggle --  internationally -- for schools to adjust to refugees and migrants.

But also to blame society and call for teachers to quit only exacerbates the problem. Educators and administrative staff need to build trust with the community to be transformational and while that's not an easy answer to your woes, I don't think you specifically should be a teacher if you're not prepared to work with communities on these issues.

Teaching AND Holidays OR Summer OR PE OR Course OR Physical Education,https://i.redd.it/l715bg4ln0ra1.jpg,"Two years out of college, bachelors in education, realized I hated teaching and never want anything to do with it. I'm interested in general office jobs like admin assistant. I've applied for hundreds of jobs with no avail. I can't even land a simple office assistant/front desk/secretary job.","*(Edited to add: if you think “simple” and “can’t even land” apply to office assistant, front desk, and secretary jobs, you obviously don’t have relevant experience in them. They are skilled work, and you’ve denigrated that work by that characterization. I’m reconsidering my advice below — it may be an attitude holding you back. More generously, with that perspective, it’s possible that those jobs are not the best fit for you, and that you may want to reconsider your goals.)*

I've hired a number of assistants over the years and a bunch of other roles as well. Here are some changes that would make your resume more compelling and readable *to me personally*. This is not ATS optimization, use other sites for that. For context, by the time your resume arrives in front of me, a real person, it has been through our ATS and our people ops team, and you've maybe been through at least a phone screen with those folks.


* Too cluttered, not enough visual white space. I'm already searching for wtf I'm supposed to focus on. Buy a downloadable resume template online and use it. Use a sans serif font, Times New Roman ain't it.


* Center your name in larger point typeface at the top. Consider a title in smaller typeface centered just under: ""Office Administrator"" ""Executive Assistant"" whatever. You're cementing in my mind what you do. Center your contact info in one long horizontal line a bit under that (allow some whitespace), doesn't need to be huge, I don't need your email etc, my people ops folks and the ATS have all that.

* Objective section: no one cares about this except your guidance counselor. Delete it and replace with ""summary"" section instead, and write in there in one or two short sentences what your value proposition/elevator pitch is. Not what you SEEK to do, but what value you actually bring. I'm not your guidance counselor. Yes, if I hire you, I will develop you and mentor you and do everything I can to champion your skills and ambition. But at this stage? You're already wasting my time if you don’t tell me what value you bring, but instead tell me what you’re hoping its in it for you. This is also where you say something like ""Experienced administrative assistant refocusing to corporate office support,"" or something like that -- wordsmith it to be succinct but clear how your experience relates to your summary.

* ""Key Skills"" needs to be a new section for you right under ""summary."" I don't always want to see that there but in your case, you're telling the story that your key skills transfer from your educational environments to a corporate environment. So make the case and sell it. And 83WPM is not that high, I'd consider leaving it off unless it really makes you a superstar. Post-typewriter-era, WPM is no longer the biggest selling point in an admin. Format this section only as two or three columns if needed. GPA? Not a skill. Dean’s list? Not a skill. PowerPoint, Excel, BookMaster, SQL, Stata, Scheduling and calendar management, file structures, these are skills. Google skills for the job you want, or look at job descriptions you’re applying for, and include the ones that apply to you. (Don’t lie, people do and we always find out.)

* Move ""education"" to the very bottom of this resume. Also, if you include Dean's List and GPA (I don't care, but lots of orgs and people do -- I also don't care if you have a degree, but I'm in the minority), that goes under edcuation. GPA is not a skill. Again, I'm not your guidance counselor, and your Dean's List performance doesn't tell me you're going to have the EQ to gatekeep my calendar without pissing anyone off, or whether you're going to ask a colleague with a recognizable name for a selfie.

* Left hand column, I need to see your work history (job titles) first. Put a little whitespace between ""experience"" and the first job. I care less about the chronology and more about the progression of roles. THAT's what tells your story. So the left hand column, vertically top to bottom, I should see: Bookseller (actually, can you reframe this to be a little more clear how it's directly relevant, like ""sales clerk - books"" or ""sales administrator - books""?); Administrative Assistant - Education; Assistant - Education; Assistant - Education; etc.

* Reformat all of the dates, locations, bullet points. This is unreadable, and it does not sell your skills in a way that makes it really clear how they'd help ME in running my office. I'd suggest something more like (I'm totally making this up, do NOT use this, this is mostly crap and just a quick example of reframing):

**Sales Clerk - Books and Retail**

Barnes & Noble | Seattle | 2022-2023

* Provide excellent customer service via phone and email; consistently rated 9.7 out of 10

* Managed all aspects of vendor relationships and inventory, including database operation, resulting in 100% on-time orders and 99.8% customer and vendor satisfaction ratings

* Fulfilled wide variety of general and specific customer requests, resulting in 4.9-star store rating on Google Business and highest store performance in the district


In other words, don't tell me what you did. Tell me about the impact your work had, how we know that (the numbers), and sell me on why you'll be able to do the same for me. You don't have to list the state with the city, most of the time that's obvious from context. And we'll drill down into details like that when we do the background screen if you get that far in the process. Or right up front, if our process is shitty and we make you regurgitate it all manually into the ATS when you apply.


And some additional notes: you may have trouble getting through an ATS to a real human because you show no current employment (there's a bias against that), and because your work engagements are mostly less than six months each. Most companies will have ATS configured to scan for that. You'll need to explain that if you do get through to a live human. It might be that you hated every job, it might be that they were all internships, it might even be that it's explained somewhere in those bullet points, but as a hiring manager, I'm skimming, not studying, your highlights when I decide whether to have my team set something up with you. So make it clear RIGHT away. If it was an internship or student teaching, in this case, it would be much better to call it that right in the job title, because those make sense as short-term engagements.

Routinely, I see a ""functional resume"" format recommended for those situations, in which you might consider grouping similar work experiences together.

There's nothing wrong with being fresh out of college with limited experience. Do not be afraid to add white space to your resume. It desperately needs it from a readability standpoint. I don't see anything here that warrants a full page of Times New Roman 10-point.


And remember that this is a marketing document. It's an ad. It's a teaser. This is the clip that gets me to click into the full Insta reel.  Tell me what's going to make me want to talk with you more and learn more. Don't tell me every detail about your work life.",arbitrosse,2023-03-31,Ireland

If you decide to take your masters in teaching from an American university you run the risk of it not being valid in Ontario and I think majority are state specific.

There’s relatively little lesson planning and you don’t really have to grade papers. The kids who have problems in other classes are more likely to like your class. You get to go to work in your shorts/sweats. You don’t take work home with you. You’re getting paid as much as the person who teaches math. 

The downsides: PE jobs are difficult to get. There are more people who want to do P.E then there are jobs available. In a high poverty schools with high turnover, the P.E teachers are the ones who will likely have  the most seniority. Teachers tend to get P.E jobs and retire in them. You won’t have as much flexibility on where you work as other teachers. If you get a job at a district/ school you hate, you will likely be stuck indefinitely until another P.E job opens up. 


There’s a strong possibility that you would have to coach in order to get a P.E job.",Newthrowaway1765,2023-04-13,Ireland

As a SpEd director, some of the things I’ve been in place:

-made it clear that there is no “lead” teacher, they are both “co-teachers” and there is no “your kids” or “my kids.”
- everyone grades, everyone plans, everyone prints, everyone maintains parent contact 
- enforced a strict deadline of how many days in advance the gen ed teachers provides gen ed materials, and how many days in advance of teaching the sped teacher shares the modified/ supplemental materials,  if either party isn’t meeting deadlines, they have to start submitting them to their coach, the sped teacher and the sped coach in a weekly email so everyone can see when they are being shared 
- weekly meetings on the calendars with notes on what coteaching models each team is using every day, what SDI is being provided, what the groups are and why, what goals are being worked on and how 
- practice co-teaching with live feedback from peers and admin before the school year starts 
- SpEd teachers are never pulled from class to sub for other classes.   If either teacher is out either absent or for an IEP meeting, the remaining teacher asks for coverage if they want it 
- ongoing professional development throughout the year for coteaching pairs to reflect on their practice
- sufficient prep time to accomplish this (schools I’ve worked as admin and teaching in either had 3 prep periods per day plus a duty free lunch, or 4 periods a day)
- Gen Ed teachers need to be reminded by their managers when they are not working collaboratively- I’ve had to remind quite a few Gen Ed teacher than their sped co-teacher not only has ten years of experience on them, but also has a Gen ed license, so they should consider their partnership to be an opportunity to constantly observe a master, veteran teacher

On the flip side, I was once a gen ed teacher who had co-teachers come in my room. I had two who said “I’m not a math person” and then proceed to sit in the back and do nothing unless I specifically asked for it. I had one who actively helped with everything though, and that one good experience convinced me of the efficacy of good co-teaching.

I hate it that some gen ed teachers are horrible and even oppressive, including and sometimes particularly to sped teachers and students. But there are still some of us out here who do try our best and respect sped teachers for their expertise and role. I WANT to co-teach to the fullest and I have no interest in treating sped teachers like aides. I want to work together with sped teachers like the experts in their fields that they are. 

But… I’ve worked in 2 schools now, completely different locations and districts, both with seemingly no structure and no support for gen ed and sped teachers to work together and collaborate on planning. We are left to our own devices to coordinate and admin does not provide us extra consideration or time for arrangements. There is no sort of supervisory body or even individual that is checking to see if anyone is actually collaborating or co-teaching so there are both no resources on the front end and no accountability on the back end. My own pedagogy program also didn’t give me much direction in terms of how best to cooperatively plan, so even when I do take the time to meet or if I’m trying to come up with my pieces of the puzzle on my own, I’m not always sure where to start, and I don’t always feel like I’m contributing well. I’m doing my own research on the side and I’ve also subbed here precisely so I can get better at this, and support our sped students better. However, I am overcome with the feeling that this should be a pre-existing part of my job. Myself and the individual sped teachers in our school should not have to coordinate all of this on our own.

I’m coming to believe this is a structural/systemic issue. I can only assume it’s riding the tails of many disabilities having been stigmatized and sped not being seen as a priority. For what it’s worth, I’m trying to do what I can to advocate from the gen ed side, but I’m not convinced this will resolve until there is greater admin buy-in. And for that, we are going to need to work together. Please try to give less attention to the horrible gen ed teachers and seek out those of us who are on board with sped advocacy instead.

We would lesson plan together and each of us would teach two of the days per week. One day of the week I would take half the class including all of the kids with IEPs and a random assortment of the rest and go to my classroom. I had more tech and visuals as my co-teacher didn’t like using them as much and I always had food to pass out in my room ( I brought in foods from the culture we would study in world history) so no one minded. This took two years to get together though. It really helped co-planning as then it was easier to cover if one of us was gone or I had an IEP meeting. For the most part we tried to keep pairs working together that could do this and the gen Ed teachers that weren’t great to work with we rotated the sped in there every year until we found a group that clicked.

It sounds nice, but are the kids actually learning to read? 

Maybe things are different in secondary. I'm in elementary (and mostly primary, at that) where we're desperately trying to teach kids how to read in the first place. The students I work with need thousands, if not hundreds of thousands (for some) of repetitions to learn and retain each piece. The smaller the group, and the more direct the instruction is, the more they learn. Having two teachers in front of the room accomplishes nothing. Having the sped teacher try to teach a small group in a noisy classroom where we're purposefully increasing the cognitive load (by making them tune everything else out) in the name of ""inclusion"" is not okay. 

Let's say that maybe in the older grades it's more effective, and there's a valid reason for doing it in the first place, just for argument's sake. I don't think it's ever going to work on a large scale. Teachers by nature are fairly controlling people. You wouldn't sign up to lead a class of 30 children all day if you didn't actually want to be in charge. And we can give lip service to ""both teachers are equal,"" but unless they are both in the SAME classroom 100% of the day, there is no real way to make that happen. Any time the sped teacher is coming into someone else's classroom, for only part of the day, it's always going to be them going into an already established room, and by default, the person who is in that room 100% of the day is going to be ""the leader.""",haley232323,2023-04-08,Ireland

So, you just saw that! Now, the anti-CRT crowd is fully admitting they never cared about CRT. They just don't want to have anything taught that involves race whatsoever. They don't care about helping black and brown children while at school. They only care to silence the fact there are problems involving race. This is some BS. Even if there exists to be factual evidence of disparity by race, now they are saying if you even acknowledge that, it's a violation.

A practical hunting course would teach so much about the local (and maybe beyond) ecosystems and survival skills that even if someone never went hunting, they'd still be much more aware of their surroundings and the impact that their behaviors have on them.

I've talked to friends for a while about how it would be great to have fire arms education in schools.  General ignorance of firearms, especially from well meaning parents who shield their children from anything relating to firearms is dangerous.

Parents can choose to not own a firearm, and keep their child ignorant of firearms, but what happens if that child, or that child's friend finds a firearm discarded outside, or at a friends house?  Tragedy is a typical outcome.

A child should be taught, from a young age, to respect, and understand what a firearm can do, and how to react in uncontrolled situations.  We can't control how responsible everyone else will be with a firearm; the best we can do is educate our loved ones, in the hope that any situation can be safely handled.

This would in turn improve discussion relating to laws surrounding ownership and other legal matters.  Remember that these children will become adults one day, and constructive exposure is a good step in the right direction.

I'd personally be very happy to see this in schools everywhere; I just never thought I'd see the day where it was actually implemented.",Fruit_Face,2019-01-16,Ireland

He said not until I know how to safely use a gun. Me being young and dumb said ""I'll learn"" so my old and wise grandpa taught me. We went shooting a BB gun at cans. He drilled into me the golden rules. Of which there are 4. And after a few weekends hanging out with him he offered to have me dispatch a cow for him. 

Absolutely nothing prepared my 12 year old self for killing an animal. We grab a rifle. Probably a 204 or 22-250. Something bigger than 22lr but still pretty small. And we had a cown in the pen. He told me to shoot it right between the eyes. 5 feet away I aimed and pulled the trigger. My ears rang and I couldn't hear a thing. The cow stood there for what felt like hours and finally softly laid down to rest. Blood was everywhere. Bucko(my gramps) told me to make sure she was dead. Told me to listen to her chest and see if I could hear her heart. I laid on her and listened. The moment i realized how warm she was, and with no heart beat I broke down. I bawled my eyes out over a cow. I laid on her and wouldn't let go. I felt horrible. 

The experience was concluded with buck saying ""it shouldn't be easy to kill anything. It is sad but necessary. Be grateful for the life that was lost to feed you."" It has stuck with me. I do hunt regularly. And I make sure to always express how grateful I am for the animal. 

That trauma is something i wish everyone would feel. I think most murderers would think twice before realizing what really happens when someone or something dies. There is no glory. Pride? Sure. Be proud of a successful hunt. But you should never be happy about a death.",Shamroc_14,2019-01-16,Ireland

I grew up in a small city in Montana. We had to learn basic marksmanship in 7th grade (in the mid 1990s) as part of PE, using .22 rifles and a short shooting range in the basement of the school. I think we had 3 lectures and then two range sessions. Many of my classmates were rancher’s children and grew up with guns as a regular tool on the job. Having us all go through safety and marksmanship together meant that we all learned, in front of our peers and friends, that guns were a tool, were to be handled safely, and did not make you seem cool or badass. Some of my peers were already ahead of me, having been taught by their parents (I wasn’t) and gave me tips on how to improve. A mall ninja’ed AR15 would have been viewed as silly if not stupid. 

It also taught us how to handle a firearm and unload one safely, in case we ever came across one. 

This was all pre Columbine. But I can’t shake the feeling that the demonizing of guns isn’t making them go away, and in fact is accidentally deifying them in the minds of psychopaths. ",prometaSFW,2019-01-16,Ireland

It teaches you firearms aren’t toys, how to properly store/transport/use firearms and ammunition. One thing I have noticed in California since I moved here is many people who want guns (in general) suspended as a right have either never fired/used a firearm or just simply don’t have any education on firearms. I guess it’s important to me because it made me realize those skills they teach, make you to be a more responsible gun owner because you’re a more educated gun owner. I truly think firearms should absolutely be a right but I also think certain firearms (ie handguns, long range rifles, high capacity weapons) should require proof of adequate education.

Also took two trips to a fish hatchery for some reason.

Best example of this: songwriters than can't sing. They still know all the notes and all the music language and what will sound good, doesn't mean they have to be able to perform it themselves. 

Same applies with gym and sports. I can know all the moves and training drills, as well as plays, workouts to do to focus on certain areas and nutritional information whole being fat. The fact doesn't affect their cognative functions. There is literally a saying that goes ""those who can't do, teach."" So I'm really not sure why you think a gym teacher needs to be in good physical condition.

But what she lacked in physical ability she more than made up for in personality. She was the most amazing coach, mentor, your organiser, team operator, and remains one of my favourite teachers to date. In fact, most pupils are still personally in touch with her 25+ years later and we’re all adults.

Secondly a PE teacher should not be fit but I will give you that they should not look outright unhealthy, note that we might have different views on what looking unhealthy means. 

And lastly a PE teacher just as any teacher really have one ""trick"" that makes them good teachers and that is their knowledge of the subject matter and a knowledge of how to teach

One was going to play pro-football but was caught taking drugs.. Or was caught with drugs? People said it was just weed, but others said he was using roids during that period of time.

And my other teacher was fairly jacked, only slightly getting a dad bod. With his wife being ""obese"". But she just had a set of kids and was working off the weight again. Which makes sense.

There was one PE teacher that wouldn't fuck around though. Kids would often complain and say he's asking them to do too much, and that he couldn't do it. So he did everything he told them to do. He would do the suicides, he would do the push-ups, sit-ups, he would do the runs, and would do the weightlifting. He did it so the kids would know he isn't someone who is fat and doesn't know anything about actual health or physical exertion. Which garnered some respect from kids and others were annoyed.

I just wish I wasn't so insecure when I went to highschool.. And elementary school. I always felt people would mock the way I would run, so I wouldn't run as much. I got insecure people would mock the way I throw a ball, kicked a ball.. Etc. I didn't want to look like an idiot so I wouldn't get bullied.

I grew up Mormon in Europe... and to be honest that messed up Propaganda was something that was annoying. They tried to teach us youths that „their“ way was the only good one and also what „God“ wanted from us. Their way is of course to stay pure until marriage.

“There is no true Latter-day Saint who would not rather bury a son or a daughter than to have him or her lose his or her chastity – realizing that chastity is of more value than anything else in all the world.”
(Prophet Heber J. Grant, Gospel Standards, complied by G. Homer Durham, p. 55)

“It is better to die in defending one’s virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle.”
(Spencer W. Kimball, LDS Prophet, The Miracle of Forgiveness, p. 196)

...What in dumb? 

But others like Deanna Holland said the teaching of refusal skills, now part of the state standards, “lets us teach children the necessary skills the good representative wants. I’m uncomfortable adding consent into our curriculum when our current curriculum already teaches these safety skills.”

This is genuinely disturbing because I prowl on social media from time to time and there was a discussion on consent. I found it wasn't being taken seriously at all. Comments like ""no means no until it means yes"", there were people disclosing they have been victims of stealthing and/or condom sabotage.

I was 14 when my bishop asked me alone, in his office if I masturbated.  I was 17 when another bishop in a different state asked me if I orgasmed during a fling with a boy.  The Mormon church, by not stopping these interviews is ACTIVELY participating in manipulation and abuse.  It’s as simple as that.  The Mormon church was run by men in the first 60 years who practiced polygamy and married 14,15,16 year olds.  It is an abusive cult.  Don’t let active Mormons tell you otherwise.

The Frankfurt school created critical theory, Hitler tried to kill them all, they fled Nazi Germany, a group ended up in the states was hired by the United States Office of Strategic Services where they used the analytic prowess of critical theory to help the US outmanuever, out strategize, and defeat, the fucking Nazis.

Which is why Nazis have been raging about Critical Theory and other Frankfurt school concepts since WWII nonstop, all the way up to today. They hate critical theory because it helped defeat the Nazis.

It depends on where you've been trained and if you have a double degree (so for example my uni offers Phys Ed and Science / Health so you can be employed in a different spot.)

I've had good PE teachers before - they understood that some people AREN'T sporty at all, and will be left out. 

They've also had a good rapport with people in the community; the few lads as PE teachers I've had are also in the footy reserve team and coach. The ladies occasionally play netball or golf. Some of them have Outdoor Ed degrees, so they go on all the camps. Those are generally blokes or sheilas who have a good report with The Lot; so it's like ""oh I know him outside of school, that's Nick from footy, but inside school he's Mr F"" or ""Oh, that's my brother's wife, Liz can cook."" Or, they're just jokers and can't get on with Nerds. 

TLDR: 

people who can get on with all students rather than have favourites are good, pe is alright but can be overstocked with teachers, gotta learn AFL and swimming.

E: the one I really liked I know her mum and dad, so it's like ""Oh, how's Ronda?"" or ""Oh how's Francis"" yknow. But she got everyone and was nice all round, considering our PE group was 25% nerdy kids.

Teaching AND Holidays OR Summer OR PE OR Course OR Physical Education,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/m58c9h/physical_education_teaching_opportunities_in/,Physical Education Teaching Opportunities in Israel?,"Physical education is part of the curriculum in Israel with mandatory of 4-6 hours of PE a week. Also in order to get the diploma for finishing Bagrut you have to pass the PE Bagrut exam which is a 2 KM run and some sort of physical exam. Despite all of that and maybe its subjective on my part as someone who finished high school not too long ago its not hard to be a PE teacher. You get a lot of social benefits and a lot of days off. As long as you have finished bachelor degree in the field you will be fine. Be aware though that pay is not that good if you are not a private trainer and would recommend to work for companies as an instructor for the workers as the pay is a lot better.

Edit: I forgot to mention but I assume you know it.  Learning Hebrew is really important if not mandatory to get a job in Israel period and especially in education.

If I buy a set of headsets for my students to work collaboratively in the same app, do I need to set up a separate Meta account for each headset, and purchase each app multiple times? Does Meta provide any solutions for education? What's my best course of action here? Thanks :)","I work in as IT in a QLD, Australia, public primary school (P - 6).

We only have 1 Quest 2 headset, but from what I understand, Meta has no support for education systems. You need to have a Meta account for each headset, and buy the app multiple times. Even if you *can* use a single Meta account, you would not be able to use them collaboratively as this would basically mean multiple users on the same account, doing to same thing, connecting to themselves. It's not likely to work.

There is another option. We have 16 ClassVR headsets. These are cheaper and are made *specifically* for education. However, for that you are definitely getting an inferior product in terms of interaction compared to the quest 2, but I recommend at least looking into it to see if it's applicable for you.

Back to Quest 2. If you're not aware, looking into SideQuest. It's an application that let's you load many more applications onto the Quest headset without being limited to what's on the Oculus Store. There's a lot of paid and free educational games there you might like.

Finally, no you won't have tracking issues in a large space like that. In fact that's much better as it means plenty of space to move. But make sure to use artificial lighting and close curtains if you can. Sun rays do mess with tracking but it's not a huge deal if you're indoors.

One more thing. If you get the Quest, make sure to get a silicone cover and lens covers to minimise and issues during use and storage. KiwiDesigns sells them for about $17, and they're a very good brand.

Hope this helps. :)",Cloudy230,2023-03-21,Ireland

(physical education) in high school. Can anyone else relate to this?,"Your high school PE sounds so different to mine. I avoided it as much as I could. There was no way anyone was allowed to get away with walking and chatting on the track, the teachers would be yelling at us not to stop and basically the only reason you would get away with stopping is if you had an asthma attack or similar. At the end of the 200m sprint I last down convinced I couldn't breathe and just got yelled at cos I didn't have a doctor's note saying I was asthmatic. 

The cross country course was the worst. Can't remember if we did it in first year of high school (age 11) or not, but I remember we had to wear ""gym knickers"" which were basically just big pants that covered nothing and we petitioned in third year to be allowed short shorts instead. Also we only did cross country in the winter. The course was a little over a mile and there was always a teacher at the back making sure you didn't stop running for long. I had no idea of how to pace myself and we weren't given any advice in the matter just told to run, so I would end up gasping for breath within a couple of hundred yards. 

Track we only ever did in the summer and I think the furthest we had to do was 800m but could just be I skipped the days we were meant to do more. I got special permission to quit PE and games lessons altogether for my fifth year (and no one did them beyond that), only joined a few when they did orienteering cos I liked the map reading and the short sections of sprinting then stopping suited me better. High school managed to put me off all sport and any form of exercise until a good ten years after I left. When everyone in 6th form (final two years of high school) had Wednesday afternoons off to do sport or volunteering I chose to do advanced maths lessons to get an extra maths qualification.

In recent years I trained and ran a 10k just to prove I could do it. Mostly I proved I'm definitely not built for running, I'm pretty sure I have mild asthma and I just hate the feeling in my lungs. I had to put in ten times more training than my friends for the same race and I know someone who ran that with no prior running training at all. But it also made me think how much better school could have been if they actually trained us in running.",Sufficient_Task3303,2022-08-15,Ireland

1. \+20 years of standardized testing and what do we have to show for it?
2. Expecting schools to pick up additional services (mental health, nursing, nutrition, etc) yet underfunding those same things both in schools and by cutting community programs.
3. The lack of accountability of students, parents, community, and govt for their roles in education.
4. Technology positives and negatives in education, the increase of mental health issues, the loss of social skills, the increase of bullying via social media.
5. Why do we still have local school boards/local property taxation for schools when there are rampant equity issues both inner city and rural?

What issues do you think we should explore?,"I think some other folks gave some great answers, so I won't add too much.  That the key topics I'd want to cover are:

Special Education - It's a rich area of scholarship and says a lot about the intersection of society, education, and people who are labeled with ""disabilities"". 

Critical Pedagogies - I'd also cover current events and Critical Race Theory in this topic - I think to cover the Critical Pedagogies you need to look at Reality Pedagogy, Culturally Relevant Teaching, Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy, and in this climate probably Teaching for Social Justice.  Maybe Trauma Informed as well, since so many students will likely be entering into districts that at least use this language.  Here you'd want to look at Zoretta Hammond, Chris Emdin, Bruce Perry, Django Parris, and plenty of others. 

Budgeting - Can't talk about schools and society without examining budgets.  I always stress to my students that the best way to see what a district prioritizes is examining where they spend money.  It's also just eye opening to students what the fixed costs of running a school are.  I try to introduce the idea of resources following need here too.  Derek Black, who wrote Schoolhouse Burning, has some good articles on school budgets. 

Discipline - Again, I'd start big picture (discipline disparities), then work my way down to what schools are trying to do to address it and what the evidence says about that (Restorative Justice is always a fun topic to get college students talking about).  

COVID - Trust me, whether you want to talk about COVID or not, your students will have a lot to say about it.  I think some of our best classroom discussions were started by students asking ""Well, how does this work with COVID?"" so I just started leaning into it with the caveat that I certainly was no expert and my district tried our best but made plenty of mistakes along the way.  

Testing 

Some historical context for how we got to where we are - A Nation at Risk, have them look at key pieces of legislation (Race to the Top, NCLB, GOAL 200, ESEA, etc.)...you could go even further back and look at Booker T. Washington and WEB DuBois debates, John Dewey, George Counts, etc.  

Finally, I try to end somewhere hopeful, so I look at some historical and current models that are seeming to demonstrate some success (IB programs, Freedom Schools, try to lean on my network to come give some guest talks about initiatives in their districts that are promising, etc.).

Suggested readings: compare the writings of Charles Eliot (former president of Harvard, advocated for the narrow, specialized curriculum) to those of Jeremiah Day (former president of Yale, advocated for a broad, general education curriculum).

Other topics that are interesting: metrics of success and what they reveal about what is valued in society; credentialism; whether higher education is truly the “great equalizer” or further perpetuates inequality; food insecurity and how schools can help combat it; the history of U.S. higher education—for instance, how higher Ed has evolved over time to meet the needs of an advancing society (read Thelin’s a History of Higher Education)",[deleted],2021-12-21,Ireland

*The medical field is a highly dynamic and ever-evolving field that requires continuous learning and innovation. With the advancements in technology and medicine, it has become even more important for medical professionals to stay up to date with the latest developments. The development of multimedia tables is one such innovation that has the potential to revolutionize medical education and practice.*

Multimedia tables, also known as interactive displays, are computerized devices that allow users to interact with digital content in a hands-on and intuitive way. These tables can be used in a variety of settings, including schools, hospitals, and research institutions. In the medical field, multimedia tables can be used for a range of purposes, including patient education, training, and research.

The development of multimedia tables for medical education is a complex and multi-disciplinary task that requires a combination of skills from various fields, including computer science, engineering, and design. The process of developing a multimedia table for medical education typically involves several steps, including ideation, research, prototyping, testing, and deployment.

Ideation is the first step in developing a multimedia table for medical education. This involves brainstorming and generating ideas for what the table should be used for and what features it should have. During this stage, the team should also consider the target audience and the learning objectives they hope to achieve.

Research is the next step in the process and involves gathering information about the target audience and the latest advancements in the field of medical education. This information can be used to inform the design of the multimedia table and ensure that it meets the needs of the users.

Prototyping is the process of creating a working model of the multimedia table. During this stage, the team will test and refine the design, ensuring that it meets the requirements of the project and the needs of the users. This stage is also an opportunity to identify any potential problems and make any necessary changes to the design.

Testing is the next step in the process, and involves putting the multimedia table through a series of tests to ensure that it meets the quality and performance standards. This stage is crucial as it allows the team to identify any issues and make any necessary adjustments to the design before the final deployment.

Deployment is the process of releasing the multimedia table to the target audience. This stage involves setting up the table, training the users, and providing ongoing support and maintenance.

Also known as interactive displays, multimedia tables are computerized devices that allow users to interact with digital content in a hands-on manner. They have a multitude of applications, including in schools, hospitals, and research facilities, and can be used for various purposes such as patient education, training, and research.

The creation of multimedia tables for medical education is a challenging and interdisciplinary task that requires skills from various fields such as computer science, engineering, and design. The process involves several steps, including ideation, research, prototyping, testing, and deployment.

The first step, ideation, involves brainstorming and generating ideas for the purpose and features of the multimedia table. The team must consider the target audience and learning objectives during this stage. Research is the next step and requires gathering information about the target audience and current advancements in medical education to inform the design of the table.

Prototyping is the stage where a working model of the table is created, and the design is tested and refined to ensure it meets the requirements and needs of the users. Testing is then conducted to ensure the quality and performance standards are met, and any necessary adjustments are made before final deployment.

Deployment involves releasing the multimedia table to the target audience, setting it up, training users, and providing ongoing support and maintenance.

We are currently in negotiations for a 10%-14% raise. No additional duties aside from teaching. Free lunch and prep. Cost of living is high but it’s expensive many places. Our state universities and colleges are very affordable. 

I would only be a teacher in a state where they have an excellent teachers union, pay and district where if admin gets a raise teachers get a raise if teacher’s insurance is cut admins insurance is cut-basically admin and teachers salaries nd health benefits are directly tied to each other. This is the structure on my district. Very beneficial for teachers. Current cap pay at 26 years with a masters is 138k but like I said we are expecting at minimum a 10% increase after negotiations. Money mainly comes from state. Newsom invested a ton more of state funds into education k- university. Some property tax funds go to schools but not main source.

I love what I do and have amazing admin support.  My students are awesome in general- always an immature goober or too but that’s the age usually. Almost 30 years in and yes I could make more money somewhere else but I have passion and know I’ve made a difference in many kids lives over my career. I’ve also been lucky to marry my best friend 30 years ago who has same goals/lifestyle health and is a great partner who makes about same as me. We own a house, good investments and putting 2 kids through college. I think it would be tough if I didn’t have excellent medical but luckily I do. 

Changes need to be made now in education and that means voting for policies that support public education and those that serve and Sheppard the next generation.

Disturbing: ""Girls will dress sexy to get good grades from male teachers."" I might ask follow ups to that to put the responsibility on the school such as

Have there been problems with teachers molesting students at this school? If so, how were those issues addressed? Are there any teachers currently at this school whom I should know about and keep an eye on to better protect my students?

Also a bit disturbing: the one calling out a particular girl for her breasts. It appears that whoever said this is sexualizing the body of a child.

One thing I will mention from my own pre-pubescent and pubescent years was that at that age I experimented a lot with fashion and looks and so did a lot of the other kids. I went through lots of fashion phases including sometimes wearing crop tops and short babydoll dresses and sometimes clown-levels of make up. Eventually I kind of figured out what I was comfortable with and settled into a more consistent style. In retrospect I think it was empowering as a girl to be able to decide for myself what I myself was comfortable wearing in the world.

With regards to the boys getting distracted thing, it is important that boys learn from a young age what is appropriate behavior and that they are ultimately responsible for their behavior. Getting practice early on in being respectful regardless of what a girl or woman is wearing is invaluable, especially when there is a compassionate male authority figure to calmly correct unacceptable behavior and be available to discuss it with the boys. You can tell your fellow teachers that it's actually a great opportunity for a male authority figure to provide compassionate guidance to these boys about how to navigate respectfully among women and girls in the real world.",BubblySolid6,2023-01-27,Ireland

Bonus points if you encourage male students to stand up against the dress code also--it's especially entertaining if a boy breaks dress code every day for a month (not a single administrator will notice or care), then politely asks why the girls get punished instantly the second they wear something ""distracting."" 

Of course in the mean time just ignore it if someone breaks dress code in your class. Make sure you understand the power structure in your school--in the US there is an elected ""school board"" that oversees the district. This school board is usually required to hold public meetings so that people in the district can voice concerns. Administrators at a school get real nervous if a student stands up in a school board meeting and reveals that girls are being punished in unreasonable dress codes while boys breaking the rules are ignored.",stubble3417,2023-01-27,Ireland

That is a terrifying answer. I hope you can call out and expose the fucked up person who said that.

I think an expectation the students wear attire that is a appropriate and functional to the workout they are doing makes sense (so long as you can also provide backups to students who have trouble getting clothes that meet that criteria). Anything other than that is outlandish and illustrates a serious problem with the adults enforcing the rule. I can imagine that it must be tough to constantly have to punish 15 year old boys for staring inappropriately at women, but disciplining children is unfortunately part of the job of being a teacher at that level. And all the stuff about sexualizing the attire choices of your students is beyond fricked.

That said, is there not a good argument to be made that students should have to wear a separate T-Shirt for gym class? Seems to me you want to be able to ensure students aren't A) getting their regular clothes sweaty and B) are wearing something they won't be afraid of getting damaged (preventing them from putting in effort). They always made everyone wear the same ugly gym shirt when I was in HS for those reasons and it honestly made sense to me.",notsoinsaneguy,2023-01-27,Ireland

All kids must wear a white tee shirt that is long enough to cover the torso. Pants must be at whatever length is already allowed (when I was a kid it was wherever your fingertips went to on your thigh) or maybe knee length like basketball shorts. 

Girls will still find ways to express themselves and feel cute if that’s what they want, boys will also have to comply, and kids who maybe feel more self conscious will be able to just blend in a little better in gym class.

This gives the impression of having been a tactical mistake. The policy was already enacted, so it already had majority support among your colleagues. You need allies to push back against groupthink.

If you have tenure then you should be free to network with students and their parents to push back more effectively and get the dress code changed.

If the answer is no, then your options are massively limited in the world of TEFL.  
It is possible to get work permits in Poland and Czechia and I know people who have done so. There are a few TEFL schools who know the process and will be able to help.

To be honest, I'd usually say don't even bother. Pay is poor and your chances of getting legal work are slim. However! Given that you are an experienced licensed US teacher with a master's degree, you will probably have one big option that most Americans don't - working in US curriculum international schools.

I have no idea of the legalities, but I know of a large number of Americans who teach at American international schools in the UK for example. Note you would likely not be teaching TEFL, but a similar English/ English Literature curriculum to your current school. This is the wrong group for that though. Check out this group - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Internationalteachers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Internationalteachers/)

On your other question. No, you can't legally work at a summer camp in Europe if you don't have the right to live and work in any European countries. Angloville is probably fine (not a legal expert!) - but I think it is a bit of a scam expecting people to work for free when their students pay decent money for the courses. Also, doing a few weeks for Angloville is not going to give you much insight into life at an American high school in Europe.  
I'd say the best way is just to come over on a holiday. Visit a place you're interested in during shoulder season (May/ September) when things will be cheaper/ quieter, but weather still good.

You’re massively over qualified for it (generally just need a degree and to be native, no teaching requirements at all) but it’ll get you a visa to be in Spain.

Alternatively, as a way into Europe (definitely not a long term thing) there is a company called 16…something I think? They have English schools in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Zaragoza and Bilbao. They help UK citizens post-Brexit, so
I’m not too sure about US citizens, but both of us need visas now so hey, maybe they could help?

Side note: the former is only 4 days a week, half a day, and the pay is terrible (€700 euros a month). You can live on it fine, as I still managed to pay rent+bills and travel somewhere in Spain every month. Also you technically can’t work on the side doing it, (emphasis on technically as my school basically got me extra work).

The latter school is super dodgy, in Zaragoza the manager was arrested for Fraud while I was there. And pay is also not the best.

Not sure about the rest of Europe but Spain might have options within TEFL if you’re set on trying that out?",teb_22,2023-03-07,Ireland

It’s nothing but a a social war against people who are reliant on public services. Lack of education is conversion therapy regardless of whether you are LGBT, straight or cis and it is destined to fail.

The first step is competing a Job Opportunities Assessment (JOA), as despite your degree,  you need to achieve the required 'aptitude' score to be appointed as an officer.  

The biggest thing to consider when becoming an education officer is that you will often not be doing any physical teaching.  You'll primarily be creating training programs,  developing training command systems to be used for training . There are opportunities to teach,  but these aren't the primary function unless your posted into the position.  

*not an education officer, but previously worked in Defence Force Recruiting 

A few questions to ask yourself
- are you physically fit enough to join? 
- do you have any medical conditions that prevent you from joining? Approximately only 10% of all people who apply to the ADF (complete the first stage in the process) will go on to actually join,  so it's worthwhile exploring if you can join
- would you be comfortable learning how to and using weapons such as rifles? (Everyone is training in weapons, even an education officer)
- are you happy to be moved anywhere in the country ?",Pink-glitter1,2023-04-07,Ireland

Just quit teaching a second time and back to work for a global defence contractor company in an education role. 

A few others have given valuable input but I think miss some important aspects.

Yes there is a fitness requirement, it is extremely minimal, if you can't meet it, you should consider changing your lifestyle until you can. I know that sounds harsh and judgy but I'm more saying it from the direction of this. If you can't complete the minimum fitness requirements for your age, you probably have health markers which indicate a higher risk than optimal for a few medical issues. It's supposed to be a ""bare minimum"" fitness test.

Yes you would have to move during service. It's easy to set yourself up to not move. For example defence is quite good at recognising not moving families with a teen in late high school. I'll caveat this as I've seen people argue with me before, in teaching, that ""no my spouse is definitely being told to move"" only to learn their spouse is excited for a new location and jumped at the move, but didn't communicate that to the rest of the family. Moving with defence can be very fun, the worst place you work can be time limited, i find it very hard to stay in one place nowadays.

Now onto my most important point. If you do time in defence, have a degree, attain a decent security clearance and have a reputation as being a decent worker, you will be very valuable to companies that work with defence. Both here and abroad. The job I'm returning to is $150k per year, in one location and is MUCH less work than classroom teaching. 5 weeks holiday. Progression plan to a WFH job where I can move wherever I want in Aus. Career progression like this didn't exist for me in teaching.",lochie97,2023-04-07,Ireland

I went to mainstream school. I did so well. I was a high achiever, very smart for my age. I knew all my timetables when I was 7, I was the first person in my class! I always did my homework on the day of. I didn't do that much reading. But I was intelligent and always won certificates. My report cards were always perfect. Teachers had nothing to say apart from my lack of social skills and participation in group activities. Because I was smart, no one suspected autism or social anxiety and I was never tested for any disorders. I didn't receive as much help as my classmates because teachers assumed I was independent and smart enough to do it on my own. I didn't have an EHCP (education and health care plan for learning or physical disabilities and SEN kids)

Then I turned 14 and everything changed for the worse. I was barely surviving. I was drowning in stress and anxiety. I was diagnosed with r/pcos , social + generalised anxiety and depression. Also undiagnosed PTSD. The pastoral manager was surprised I survived until now and why I never had an EHCP.

I was falling behind and as a result, didn't sit some of my exams. I stopped going to school at 15 and was home-schooled for a year. Didn't go back into education until 2 years later. Had a bad experience with college (the last 2 years of American high school). From age 11 until now, I struggled a lot and was no longer a ""high achiever"".

Did you have an iep?","Mainstream schooler here, but me and my parents knew I have above average intelligence (by no means a genius, just a little higher, I think IQ 120 or so but that's bs anyway, did another and it was lower and I was tired)

Noone else knew though, it's nothing to brag about. I had obvious early signs of autism but didn't get an actual diagnosis until age 16 ish (""high functioning"" aka barely noticeable to most, doesn't impact me all too much now)

The time at school was hell. Wrong people, false friends. Got bullied a lot. Zero self confidence. Everything is too loud, I couldn't concentrate, felt restricted. I can do things better at home!

Therefore my grades were bad. So bad I barely even made it through school, they had to put me in a lower grade at one point too. Extra round. Yay (NO)!

The reasons for that are results of what I said above about mental state: 
Oral participation was too overwhelming and I was too scared of being judged so I kept quiet. Presentations were just as difficult. Couldn't score well in P.E. or art class either because I can't do much in front of other people. And even though I'm better at doing stuff at home, I never did my homework, ever. That's because I needed all the time I had just to focus on retaining some energy to get through the next day.

Everyone thought I'm slow and lazy and don't understand anything because I never did anything for class, but actually I did understand a lot, it wasn't too difficult and I never even studied for anything (only big, important exams) yet still scored As most of the time. Considered a B bad because I needed As to pass my overall grades with a C-! So B meant an overall fail.

Teachers were super confused after returning the exams like ""How are you so good? Did you cheat?"" Never have. After talking with me in private, they noticed I did understand the subject matters, but the teachers didn't understand me. ""Just say it when I ask you"" No. Please don't ask me. If you do it in class I won't be able to say something that makes sense!

I'm still at school, though at a different setting, after a few years of pause and this time it's for work. More specific information, older students. More serious environment. Now I actually am able to ace all my classes:) Which means I finally found the confidence to actually participate in class more often, and realized nobody judges you as bad as, say, in middle school or so",Chaoddian,2022-03-10,Ireland

High schools saw me getting many B’s, C’s, and D’s because of poor mental health and my “new” inability to really study and focus on/do homework. I started taking CP/non-ap classes (except my art classes which I took as AP twice and got A’s) and barely skating by until graduation.

As for religion, you would need a religious school for that. But then religious ISs (which do exist) will usually want something more .... ""dogmatic"" than a philosophical approach at the subject.

Most rational parents/adults don't care if a teacher shows mild signs of being an adult human being, like having a drink at the bar, or wearing your bikini at the beach.

Problem is . . . the few uptight extremists who do care, will go after you for your transgressions. And if your building and/or district admin is cowardly and/or toxic themselves . . . . your calm night out at the bar or your beach vacation can get you fired.

Admin fear negative press and potential lawsuits. So, if a parent hints they'll bring the issue to the press or sue the district, no matter how ridiculous the situation, those cowardly admin will cave to the pressure and punish the teacher, including up to termination. Obviously, not all admin are so cowardly and toxic.

I knew a teacher couple who went on a tropical vacation, and had their picture taken by a friend. Dude was in a speedo, gal was in her bikini. Friend posted the pic on Facebook and tagged them in it . . . . and somebody saw, admin or parent. Dude was reprimanded, gal was fired.

This is how it should be, we're adults and are treated as such.  I'm not working with kids that night, so why shouldn't I be able to have a drink or two?  

Parents should let teachers be adults, and this includes letting them drink when not on the job.  If the parent wouldn't complain about a random adult drinking, then they shouldn't complain just because it's an off-duty teacher.

None of us had those qualifications, and we needed to go out and hire someone just to cover AP CS as well as cover some other intro courses at our campus.

As for why they are segregating these students instead of mixing them in, my bet is safety.  While it is completely possible to be a 17 or even younger student on campus, those are mostly already graduated from HS and choose of their own free will to be there.  The school district, being part of this whole process, is not going to risk sitting a group of 16 and 17 year olds next to a person who could be 25 plus.

The most modern generations are so disconnected from the threat of and the crimes of communist regimes that they're happy to compare it as a better alternative to capitalism.

I firmly believe that true Marxists mean the best but are actually dangerous idealogues and don't actually understand how dangerous the ideology is. It's a trope to say Communism has never actually worked, but it has never actually worked, and is the ideological basis for some of the worst dictators' worst crimes (dekulakization, collective farming in both USSR and China).

I appreciate Marxists who approach the issue from a mostly economic standpoint, observing where the markets fail and where capitalism fails to keep the markets from abusing people.

I'm not opposed to young kids being told communism is bad. Once they're old enough though, they should also learn why it's dangerous (it sounds pretty sweet), and what it is exactly (it's not just take from the rich and give to the poor, it's a complex restructuring of the state and it's economic and social law). But, it's also an ideology of revolution against the elite, and demonizing the elite as evil is certainly more counterproductive than seeing the successful and admiring their achievements in hopes one day we can achieve the same.

We don't need to teach kids that regulating industries to keep workers from being abused is communism, or that taxing the rich heavily is communism. It needs to be an honest observation, and I suspect deSantis' educational directives will include undertones like this.",yaya-pops,2023-03-13,Ireland

Are you familiar with the term, 'lip service?' It's when you say/do things to appear to agree with 'them' when you really don't at all, Very useful when you want to keep the peace, or have something to gain by keeping the peace.

In this case - you are  a student, with a course to pass.

Teacher identified as an ally, and is teaching a course that was already outlined for her - she is only delivering the information that was given to her. 

Nothing of what you've written above indicates that she's racist. Your aggravation at being taught that specific course by a white person is racist, however. Yes, even half&halfs can be racist.

I'm a white presenting Indigenous too, from Ontario Canada. You  have a distinct advantage. Learn how to use it.

Your white presenting self has access to places other indigenous people don't, simply because of the colour of your skin. USE IT to YOUR and YOUR PEOPLES advantage. 

LISTEN CAREFULLY. Hear the message behind the words of the course. What is it really teaching you? Go along with the course material and pass that class so you don't have to repeat it. 

I know it's VERY ANNOYING to be taught about 'yourself' from someone 'on the outside'. It sucks. You want to change that? LIP SERVICE TIME! You're a young cub, I can tell, but very near full adulthood. Still learning. Use that to your advantage. LISTEN CAREFULLY! Write down what you don't agree with, and why. The WHY is very important.

Further to your written assignment. It sounds like the kind of novel/movie I'd like to be entertained with. Continue on, but this is YOUR project now, not a class assignment. Seriously, redo your class assignment. In today's world of school violence, it's not good to submit something that tells how you'd take them down, lol.

I get you have big ideas, but maybe you really should use this as a chance to focus on actions you can perform for the people near you, right now.

Sometimes people use big ideas as a shield or excuse, to not do the simple & important work in front of them on a daily basis

Look at it like this: what would be the first 1-2 steps in enacting your biggest idea?  Make that the project.  

State your overall goal in the simplest terms possible, then ask yourself - **Who would you connect with, to make your idea happen?**  Ask them about best first steps.  Use that to fuel your actions for the next week-month, and your project

You are at a time in life when you need mentors, and the best way to find them is to connect through your ideas and goals.  Share your ideas and goals with more experienced people.  Be open to their input, be open to change and learning

It’s a passionate idea, but one that isn’t feasible or well thought out.

Given that you have another opportunity to create an action plan, maybe there’s a chance to communicate the extremely valid points you’re making - showing how so much of the school curriculum is telling an incomplete story that favors colonizers and diminishes the truth of what Indigenous people experienced and continue to experience today, and laying out the steps needed to help people like your teacher understand the holes and problems in their resources.

That can really easily open the door for you to counter those statements of dismissal your teacher is making, like “that was a long time ago” or “I’m not like that.”

And this may be a helpful experience for you in the long run because there are gonna be a hell of a lot of people you’ll encounter who think v differently from you, come to different conclusions than you, and have different perceptions of history and reality than you. And you can’t get all of them removed from their position. Sometimes you have to accept people for where they are, meet them there, and educate them instead of berate or exact vengeance upon them.

The Scopes Monkey Trial has come to Oklahoma thanks to Stitt and Ryan Walters. It's no surprise Oklahoma is experiencing a windfall of teachers leaving the profession in droves thanks to them. We are going to have no teachers left thanks to them both. This is all part of their Christian nationalist plan.

Teaching <18 year olds the basics will be very different than teaching as a professor in a university. It is much more about managing emotions and behavior of your students and their parents. I would recommend getting some experience with teaching before pursuing a degree in it. Can you pick up a part time tutoring gig now? Or, even better, try job teaching English abroad.

It sounds like you’re struggling with feelings of inadequacy in your current position. PhD programs usually amplify these sorts of feelings. So I would expect that to either stay as bad as it is now or get worse if you go back to get your PhD.

Have you considered getting a PhD in a more flexible field than theoretical astrophysics? If you studied biophysics or medical physics, or a similar topic with a viable path to industry jobs, then you could keep your options open after you graduate.

And a final note: I wouldn’t recommend getting a PhD in Philosophy. Unfortunately, there isn’t enough time in life to fully explore all the topics you are interested in. I’ve taken the approach of selecting the most employable/lucrative of the set of things I loved, and I’ve been happy with how that turned out.

I teach next door to an instructor who was brought on through the current/former military program, and she is doing well herself - does not teach tested subjects, but she's great, and her students like and respect her. I'm at an advantage, I would say, because both of my parents have been public school educators for 20+ years, so classroom management comes naturally and I have turned to my parents for advice when I run into conundrums.

Both I and my colleague are fortunate to have a great administration who oversaw a fast-paced and intensive mentorship program that got us up to speed with the day-to-day stuff, and because we aren't micromanaged and have as little paperwork as legally possible, we've been able to focus a lot on developing teaching skills and even taking elective PDs in our generous planning period. I'm teaching without a planning period this semester, due to taking on an extra class, and I've been able to handle it better than I expected. Teaching is my second job - I'm a consultant in my field as well - but I've been thinking of just teaching, moving forward, especially since giving up my planning for an extra class gave me a substantial raise. I teach 25-27 students in every class this semester - no more than 30, ever - and it's been very doable.

Teaching AND Holidays OR Summer OR PE OR Course OR Physical Education,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/116a258/at_the_beginning_of_the_school_year_some_states/,At the beginning of the school year some states and/or districts hired people that didn’t have a teaching education. With more and more teachers shortage how is that going? Have they stayed? Are they ok?,"Thank you for asking this question! I love the fact that you're so considerate. 

A lot of us who entered teaching without a formal teaching education are NOT okay. At least as far as my current district is concerned... we aren't getting formal training or the formal support that we need to successfully do our jobs. It was a sink or swim environment and we had to figure everything out ourselves. Our coworkers were nice but way too busy to show us the ropes cause they were too busy covering empty classrooms or subbing for open positions.

Admin would constantly blame us for things that we didn't know yet were unwilling to show us the ropes themselves. We were working long hours more than any other probationary teachers who already had their preliminary credential (so at least some kind of training in education). And still despite all our efforts, it is not enough for most admins. There was also blatant discrimination between District Intern status and those who were fully credentialed probationary teachers. Some admins purposefully targeted District Interns and made their lives like a hell asking them to submit incredibly detailed lesson plans, ask for more frequent informal observations/informal walkthroughs, monitor bathroom breaks... etc.  To add further wound, all of our students have suffered some kind of learning loss due to the pandemic and the effects are still ongoing. Somehow we're expected to catch our disabled students up to grade-level. 

My district intern program is close to getting their preliminary credential this June (we are almost at end of Year 2) and more than half of the program lined up to the HR professional who walked into our classroom asking to resign. The HR professional said in a very loud & firm tone ""YOU ALL ARE JUST WHINING! IT IS BAD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL AND WORKING AT THE SAME TIME. ONCE YOU GRADUATE IT WONT BE AS BAD!!!"". The HR professional also told them if they are renewed for the next year, then they still have to serve two more years of teaching in order to avoid the $12k penalty for tuition of the alternative certification program aka the District Intern program.  My classmates were so angered at the fact that they're chained for two more years in these terrible circumstances before they can entertain the idea of changing back to their old careers or trying something else different. $12k penalty is a large fee to eat up especially in a high cost of living state like ours. 

For me personally, it wasn't being in school and working at the same time that was the problem. I openly said it in front of everyone. The HR professional truly was disconnected with us and had no idea truly what the problem was.  I devoted maybe like 5 hours to school per week. The issue laid with admins not being supportive - I worked 6 days a week (Sunday through Friday). Sundays was all gone due to the detailed lesson plans my asshole admin wanted me to do - 35 pages worth across different grade-levels (K-5). I also lost a lot of time daily after school to do co-planning with every grade level AND I had to do photocopies all on my own because my assistant legit didn't know how to do it despite teaching her several times. I tried to get out of my situation by transferring to another school - 3 schools that I knew had supportive environments and got 3 job offers. My admin did not like the fact that other people loved me - she thought everyone should agree with her opinion & did not like any opposing views.... so guess what? She retaliated against me with a non-reelect and tried to slander me to other prospective schools. She also was discriminatory against my dept which was SPED and against my race/religion, which was another complex layer. 

So no, I'm not okay. And no, my classmates are also not okay. We are all traumatized by this experience. Inclusion is not the way to go for SPED and SPED should be held to different expectations that is fair and not traumatizing for our students as well. Our students have behavioral challenges because they're being held to unfair standards as well. When I leave on June 30th, I will miss my kids a shit ton, but I rather work in a different occupation where I can still work with kids but not be held to unreasonable expectations without the appropriate support. I got more support than this in Corporate America than in my current district.",chocolatelove818,2023-02-20,Ireland

They do this for every state, AND they won't let you license for a state you are not currently living in. Further, if you get your license in Utah because you are living in Utah, iirc you will need to make up all the differences when you come to California if you have less than 5 years teaching experience. I further don't recommend this because you will basically be screwing over your own pension.

Anyway, simple answer is that if you live in California they have you completely taken care of.

&#x200B;

Ok, question time.  So it seems over the past couple years, slowly but surely more people are moving to lead an open-source style of education - things like what your doing, what Khan Academy is doing, various YouTubers, etc.  - for the purpose of providing a meaningful & accurate curriculum to whomever wants it.  Furthermore, these platforms allow students to proceed at their own pace, something our current institutions don't really accommodate.  One could argue that the education & knowledge you receive within your first year or two of college (calc 1 thru diffEq,physics 101, chem 101, bio 101, etc), could be obtained over the internet *for free* at their own pace, it's just a matter of proving the knowledge obtained.  Since you've been involved in both higher education as well as ""underground"" (for lack of a better term) education, I pose two questions from this:

&#x200B;

1) Do you see the future of the US's education system (\~50 years or so) moving away from our current institutions and more towards the open-source, internet-based style that you provide?

&#x200B;

2) Currently, our universities double as not only institutions of higher learning, but also essentially cash cows. If this ""change"" of education platform were to take place, I could only assume Universities would not go down without a fight, as all money-making industries do.  In what ways do you think that Colleges & Unis would fight or push back against this change, or attempt to slow it down/discredit it?

AMA!","Are you finding that the younger generations are becoming more interested in this field?

As a Medical Engineering Post-grad, this is great. Thank you for your hard work. There's a lot of stigma in the workforce when it comes to Medical/Biomedical degrees. People often assume there's no electronics, mechanics, computation or physics involved. In fact, I've seen that, in England at least, companies are less willing to hire you because your degree classification doesn't say ""mechanical"" for example. 

More awareness into this area will help the industry tenfold. It's great to have purely electronic and mechanical designers and engineers working at medical companies. But medical engineers have the added benefit of applying the specific bio/med knowledge that is only gained through this type of degree",_wow_just_wow_,2019-06-29,Ireland

First of all i think it's worth mentioning that i'm currently 15 years old, living in Poland.  
I've been interested in engineering, physics, mathematics and proggraming for like 2-3 years now.  
I would really love to project and build things by myself, from simple ones like a calculator to things such as engines or ever cars.  
So far i didn't really get much experience, but i'm really eager to learn.  
Some time ago i started learning about Arduino, and C++.  
My question is, where to start learning so i'm gonna be able to do what i desire to in that field?  
What books to read and what videos to watch?

None of the showers had curtains, and you were given less than 5 minutes to change.

Throwing weight room into the mix in middle school only re-triggered much of the anxiety and humiliation I faced going through elementary PE. 

Then in HS they so generously put PE as my first class. Nothing is better than getting all sloppy and sweaty to start off a day of being tortured by your peers. I skipped every day.

We did a good amount athletics-based stuff such as high jump, long jump, discus throw, etc. Then there were also exercises such as cartwheels, hand stands, rope climbing and gymnastics-based exercises. Also some bodyweight exercises such as push-ups, crunches, etc. 

At my school we had a mountain path that we would jog up and down on, I hated that with a passion. At some other schools we'd go swimming, if they had access to a pool. We also did rope skipping and learned some tricks like double-under and criss-cross. 

We'd do sports like football, basketball, volleyball, badminton and table tennis, etc. 

And so much dodgeball.

We had some extra-curricular sports clubs such as Kendo, TKD and table tennis, but that's about it. I used to play volleyball after school with some teachers and other students in the summer, but that was informal lol. I think my teachers just liked volleyball.

I liked the ballsports for the most part, but the athletics-based activities made me feel so bad.

We had PE in elementary school (to age 12), and one required semester in high school. My elementary school PE teacher was overweight and a bully. I had severe asthma which was completely untreated. He'd force us to run and laugh that I was so slow and gasping for breath. We did team sports that he couldn't even demonstrate because he was so out of shape. I have very flexible joints and I'd get painful injuries often with things like volleyball and the teacher would lead the other kids in mocking kids like me that cried when we felt pain. It was something I dreaded each and every day, and all through the summer too.

I live in a place with a lot of outdoor activities and love them as an adult in spite of the terrible start I got in school. Once I finally got treatment for my asthma (in my mid twenties) I realized that I'm not inherently bad at sports, I just need to be able to breathe and take extra caution with my joints. In my late 40s I am picking up running, which it turns out I can do. I feel like our school system really failed me and I spent so much time thinking I was not able to do what I can. 

I learned nothing about training, building an athletic base, or dealing with injuries, and no one cared that I was dealing with potentially life-threatening breathing issues. I didn't learn anything positive apart from a lot of team sports that I got picked last for and got told that I wasn't athletic or capable of things like running.

I went to school in an American medium-large city district that's overall considered not bad, the sex education is especially progressive and the academics are pretty good.

PE though? Well, in middle school it basically consisted of a few tests at the beginning of the semester like a mile run, how many pushups and situps you can do, how far you can reach to your toes, repeated at the end, but in the middle absolutely nothing was done that specifically trained those abilities. Instead, every class would have some random sport you're supposed to play a game of with your classmates and when I didn't know the rules they just said ""watch, you'll catch on."" Yeah not really... everyone already didn't like me and being an incompetent team member by no fault of my own didn't help. 

In high school, I went to an alternative school where at first it was done by independent study, you had to have an adult sign off you did X hours of physical activity, with the plan approved in advance by a teacher, and later they added actual classes that resemble group classes you can sign up for at a gym - a yoga class, a circuit training class, etc. So I don't know what's standard for high school in the district but you only needed like 2 semesters of PE to graduate anyway so I bet people who played sports learned their sport and nobody else would be too invested in it.

You can become an ""embedded"" adjunct at a h.s. so you're full-time with the h.s. and have the salary, benefits, and time off PLUS get the adjunct stipend for each section you teach, the double-dip. It leads to two nice bonuses at the end of each semester and you're obviously teaching the ""better"" students who qualify. 

But as another poster mentioned the pay is low. We receive $2,180 per section per semester. However I teach multiple sections each semester so it's a wonderful incentive to stay put- after taxes it's an extra 10k a year on top of my base salary with the ISD.

Teaching AND Holidays OR Summer OR PE OR Course OR Physical Education,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/11nzvra,Have to submit a résumé for student teaching for TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages). Any glaring issues?,"Hi OP - I'm a higher Ed specialist with 8+ years experience, a good deal of which has been reviewing resumes. Not to say I'm perfect and you should take my words as complete truth, but just to give context that I have a few helpful pointers.

Formatting suggestions:

-It looks like your name at the top is on the small side. Make this bigger. Your name should stand out highly.

-I believe you can hyperlink your email and/or LinkedIn if the resume is sent as a pdf. Which I recommend doing so versus a word doc. Not everyone has Microsoft word on their machine, but everyone should be able to download a pdf. It also prevents resume reviewers from using program to see your revisions.

-You don't have to list ""expected"" next to graduation date. Listing a future date is clear enough imo

-I would move your GPA to the second line, perhaps after you describe the type of degrees. Giving it its own line feels a bit unnecessary


For the jobs/leadership positions specifically I'd suggest:

-Use stronger, more action orientated verbs. Instead of saying ""collaborated with"" just lost the tasks that you did, try to start each sentence with a strong verb. Googling ""strong resume verbs"" can help you get started. 

-You don't have to start a bullet with a descriptor of what the job was. Just jump into what you did in each position.

-I would try to flesh these positions out a bit more. You mentioned you helped coordinate events in some of these - try expanding on what those events were. You want to illustrate the impact you've had as much as possible.

-If at all possible, try to provide ""metrics"" of the services offered. This might be especially hard if you had limited responsibilities in these roles, but it can be helpful. 

Ways you might be able to do this - 

-You were an orientation leader. See if there's any data on how many incoming students you supposed, or how many peer mentor groups you facilitated. If there's no data, do a good faith estimate.

-You ran events as President of a club - Do you have data on how many club members you supported? How well your events were attended?

-Examine if anything you did within these roles had a tangible, positive impact you can describe. Going back to the linguistics club - if these were events were educational, you could say you fostered learning for X number of club members and event attendants

First, sometimes you work with a particular kind of experimental setup. As in your case if you’re doing spectroscopy by wavelength then wavelengths are what is intuitive to you and what the typical experiments measure. Over time you’ll develop a lot of feeling and inutition for what wavelengths you typically see, how much peaks are typically spread out, etc. Now, say you want to know whether the light with a certain wavelength you measured would have enough energy to ionise a particular atom. Of course, you could have a table of various ionisation energies in eV, a calculator and calculate back and forth using speed of light and plancks constant. However if you’re going to be working with these numbers more often it’s a hell of a lot easier to do the conversion to wavelength type units for the ionisation energies ahead of time. One, this saves you from having to do a calculation each time you want to compare some quantities and two, it allows you take your well developed inution for wavelengths and use it on energies, too. The same argument obviously goes for many other experimental contexts and pairs of quantities you’ll have to translate between often.

Second, if we take something like frequency and energy. There is a sense in which frequencies really are energies if you’re in the quantum context. In the same way temperature really is an energy per degree of freedom if you’re coming from the statistical physics perspective. These equivalences can be obscured by having to keep track of dimension conversion and in some sense the dimension conversion is kind of wrong. There really is no difference between talking about the wavenumber of a particle and it’s momentum. They are the same! This is why natural units can be so useful in theoretical physics. Since we already know that frequency and energy may be interchanged once you’ve acquired a certain level of expertise, it does you no good to remind yourself of this equivalence in every single equation by keeping hbar around. Same goes for Boltzmann constant and speed of light.

One caveat: it can be quite difficult to put these conversion factors back in after a long calculation and keeping track of the different dimensions does help with finding errors. If your final expression says some energy equals some frequency you know it’s wrong. But that argument only works if you actually kept track of the different dimensions. Otherwise a frequency being equal to an energy could be perfectly fine and you just need to add Planck’s constant back.",Luapulu,2022-06-22,Ireland

By analogy it's like answering the question ""how far away is it?"" with ""three hours (by car)."" Where a distance question got answered with a time. 

In this case I'd argue it can be useful to use these 'pesudo units' to put results into context for comparison. I can see where they'd be an issue if no everyone was on board with the hidden units though. Like describing nuclear weapon yeilds in terms of mega tons (of TNT).  For example, in your energy example, it's not that nm are units of energy, but that for a photon those two thing are directly proportional. Say you do a lot of spectroscopy and you deal with the wavelengths, then energies in terms of wavelengths tell you about the photos absorbed and emmited by the processes you're talking about.",Vesurel,2022-06-22,Ireland

You cannot ignore the Joules in a system that is designed to eat up energy. You cannot ignore the wavelenght in a system that uses radiation to do something.

In all of those formulas and equations, all units that aren't ultimately relevant to the resulting value are removed, often by dividing them out, as if they were algebraic variables. It may feel crude, but it legitimately is how it works, but on the flipside, that is how you get those units to gain exponents.

This is how you get acceleration: Your speed of fall increases by 9.8/second, every second. Thus you multiply the every second with itself, and you get 9.8m/s².  Likewise, if you want the mass of an object from its joule and acceleration values,  you start with a formula that talks about kg, meters and seconds. However, Joules and acceleration's units end up cancelling out, and you're left with Kilograms.

Now back to your examples:

- ""Energy as units of length"": Energy gaps ≠ Energy, but the distinct absence of it. Specifically, the distance where there are no electron states. It makes sense to describe the size of it, since it's some value you would want to keep track of.

- ""Energy in terms of spacial frequency"": This is ""closer"" to an offender, but then you have to realize that what your teacher did, is ***omitting*** the unit that should be obvious, and likely was to them: Joules.

- ""Temperature in terms of energy, not temperature"": In science, this is the norm, and in fact the correct way to do it. The actual temperature of an object is, as degrees, usually in Celsius, is directly calculated by mathing out the energy that object has (which is directly measurable and calculable), with its mass (directly measurable) and its heat capacity (how much energy (Joules) does it take to heat it by 1 degree (Celsius). To know how much something will transfer energy to something else you need to know how much energy it has, not its relative temperature. We simply tend to associate stuff with ""hotter gives heat to colder"", but it's actually ""more energetic gives joules to less energetic"", it just tends to also fit hot > cold in a solid 99.9999999999999% of the time.

You don’t seem to like that frequencies are treated as energies or that temperatures are treated as energies. However, you should realise that the dimensions you’re familiar with are somewhat arbitrary. Why don’t we distinguish between other types of energy for example? Why not give kinetic energies a different dimension and unit from potential energies? They are different quantities after all and it can be rather dangerous to confuse them.

The answer is ultimately a combination of historical reasons and usefulness. We could have more different units for energy like temperature and differentiate between potential energy and kinetic energy for example, but historically we didn’t discover physics that way. In the case of temperature and energy we only later figured out that they were actually deeply related and hence we now pretend like they’re  different, not because they really are, but because our unit system hasn’t changed.

This becomes clear if you look at the way SI units are defined these days. Because we know a temperature really is an energy, the Boltzmann constant is just defined as a number. It’s not a measured property of some system. So, the very definition of these units demonstrates that these quantities are deeply interrelated.

Sometimes distinguishing between them is useful, sometimes it gets in the way. Depends on the situation.",Luapulu,2022-06-22,Ireland

Wikipedia defines it as:

> A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and adopted by convention or by law, that is used as a standard for measurement of the same kind of quantity.

The important thing here is the idea of it being ""standard"" of ""constant"". But the implication of this is that any unit multiplied by a *constant* value is still measuring the same thing, it's *still* a definite magnitude of the same quantity, just using different units.

Joules and eV are both clearly units of energy, and can be converted between one another by multiplying by a constant. But a constant that has its own units is still a constant, so the *thing you're measuring* is still the same thing. And in your cases, the thing you're measuring is still energy. It has a difference of a constant that you can use to convert back and forth, just like converting between joules and eV.

If this bugs you, just wait until you get to some branches of cosmology and particle physics where it's common to represent the speed of light c as 1 (just 1 with *no* units).

But at the end of the day, it still meets the criteria of representing a ""definite magnitude of a quantity"" as Wikipedia puts it, it's doing the core job of a unit of measurement. If a particular choice of units makes calculations and communications easier to those within the field, then it's doing the job of a unit of measurement *well*. If most of the useful equations spit out these values, it's not helping anyone to constantly be multiplying by a constant when the value spit out by the most useful equations is easier to work with in it's nm or ""inverse cm"" forms. If they only differ by a constant, they're measuring the same thing!

And frankly, it sounds like you clearly understand what's going on. So I don't think you can even plausibly claim that this is confusing in any meaningful sense. You are not confused! It just annoys you based on this arbitrary criteria that really has little to do with the purpose of units of measurements or the field itself.",themcos,2022-06-22,Ireland

I study chemistry, and the useless people at the IUPAC, or the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry who decide the naming conventions so as to be as unarbitrary as possible, have changed the standard enough times and frequently enough that we basically ignore them and use software to figure out a molecules' name.

Granted there is more complexity in naming molecules than there is in units.

Another point: often times research is put forth describing a novel phenomenon poorly before we really understand it, and we tend to keep the poor nomenclature with us as the field progresses. This has happened in astronomy, with the star naming convention. This brings in the human aspect of getting people to agree on a convention, its time and effort that researchers may not have, that feels too big a task for any one person to advocate for successfully. How would you go about it? Is there anything inherently wrong with the system that is a big deal and leads to loads of errors as of now? Not really... so there is no reason to change, or at least it does not incur the effort.

I'm sure this is also the case with 'wavenumbers', all the machines and software in the world uses it now, but I think we can all agree the per centimeter unit trips you up. Would it make sense to change all the hundreds of thousands of softwares and machines in the worlds' units? Its just a lot of effort.

Fundy parents usually have similar expectations:

1. That their kids stay in the same religion/denomination, if possible the same church.
2. They stay completely obedient in literally every way possible.
3. They seem to think it's appropriate to be able to choose when their adult children's relationships start and end. I mean friends and romantic ones too.
4. They expect access to their grandchildren in whatever way they deem fit.
5. Same for finances.

Noncompliance will just ramp up bullying, emotional manipulation, and they often will do what they can to get siblings to get in on the action.

The most he can do besides going NC is keep the LC he basically has now and refuse to allow them to speak about you the way they do.

Op, you are doing the right things, you have both the credentials and experience to support your SO.  He has a lot to process after being ambushed.  Remember, their attack most likely isn’t personally directed at you, the JN clan wants its wage earning meal ticket back under their respective thumbs.  You’re just in the way.  If he was with some one else, she’d be the problem.  


Review their evidence.  SO is being expected to accept it on faith.  Sound familiar?  As you know from your own relationship experience, truly toxic relationships generate evidence.  Factual accounts of mental, emotional, & physical abuse.    


SO has been conditioned to accept “guidance” on faith from authority figures, right?  He has work to do to unwire those buttons and recognize behaviors and patterns of behavior.  What evidence supports the gold digger accusation?  None.  Yet they expect him to spit out money on demand like an ATM.  Because the authority figure asked…seems like lots of evidence and an identifiable pattern.

You can help by asking him how you best support him.  

When DH arrives home from a visit with his mom, I just ask, am I listening, am I problem solving, do you want to do xyz to decompress?  I let him drive it—sometimes, he wants man cave time to work it out.  Some times he wants to vent…it varies.  What is constant and has to be for our partnership to work is we are a team.

First, give your SO some grace and consider how hard it must be for him to disengage from a cult-like family.  He probably has some unexplored trauma, and will need you, and maybe a professional, to help him heal. Keep up what you’re doing with him.  Remember that he’s on the side of your relationship; he just needs more deprogramming.  As for your respective salaries- you don’t have to justify anything financial in your relationship to anyone.  

The more worrisome issue is the foster/adopted children.  No doubt MIL has hyper-controlled their existence, and you indicate they are without actual life skills.  Nothing can change that at this point, unless you want to report them to child or adult protective services.  Short of that, keep your distance from this situation:  one day SO’s parents will be looking for someone to take on the responsibility for caring for those 4 special needs people, and it shouldn’t be you and your SO.

Probably was a freeze response, but also it doesn't hurt to disengage and plan how to respond. If he had responded strongly when it happened, it wouldn't have gone anywhere pleasant and they had him in the room to continue bullying in person.

The advantage of not responding in the moment is he could discuss everything with you, take his time deciding how to respond, and make a plan. Also, it's a lot easier to enforce boundaries when you're in a different country vs in the same room.",bluebell435,2023-01-28,Ireland

But I just wanted to advocate for your sister-in-law etc for a second who are probably in a very nasty position and like we were forced to all felt they had no choice to do what mother-in-law has asked them to with this intervention. I think if SIL for example were independent adults, independent of her control, they may not of done her bidding. I hope that made sense. I know you are feeling betrayed by her, but I think she is also in a rock and a hard place herself.  

Which brings me to the next question, whether your country has an adult protective services? Seeing as she is an adult and she’s being held back significantly, is there someone out there that can advocate for her? Get her out of that situation? Help her achieve her education? 

Not only for her, but for all of them, including the minor children that haven’t reached adulthood.

If they’re significantly behind, it would be a good indicator for authorities.

I’m not saying do this in an active retaliation, I’m saying to do this for them for the kids for the young adults who are stuck in the situation. Your husband is so lucky that he got out of this situation.

Now for you. What other people think about you should be absolutely none of your business. Honestly, you will care a lot less what other people think as you get older. You stop giving a crap because they don’t contribute to your life in anyway so you lose interest in caring what others think, and just do your life. The sooner you figure this one out the better, your life quality is because you stop worrying about everybody else and start thinking about what you truly want. so want to encourage you to just continue doing your life your way and disregard what they think of you. They’re lashing out at you trying to get you to respond and to behave badly, shrug move on. Except that whatever you do, or don’t do they gonna find a reason to hate you so you may as well just live your best life.

As for your husband, he needs therapy. They raised him, they have installed in him, many things that he probably doesn’t realise, including shutting down with a pressing his buttons, which they probably see as obedience. In reality, this is him probably in protective mode. If he’s going to start standing up to them, he needs a therapist, supporting him mentally and emotionally.

You should read the NHS guidelines before getting hysterical about it. It says specifically that during the first stages, it is regarded as a possible psychological issue.

[https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/treatment/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/treatment/)

Now what do you suggest they do about it - because the equivalent you quote, anorexia, still doesn’t have a very effective “cure”. You can’t force feed any more, all you can do is keep incarcerating those affected. Are you suggesting all those who refer themselves to GIDS should be hospitalised and “converted”? Just like the now discredited treatment for homosexuality?

The NHS guidelines specifically say that a “watch and wait” attitude is the first response with anyone under 16. Then they get sued by the representatives of a 14 year old who was waiting too long for treatment.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55015959

As for teachers, as I have tried to explain to you a million times, they have to follow government guidelines, so the Department of (Tory) Education has complete control over what is taught. Teacher guidelines say that you should not “misgender” students. Teachers have been disciplined and even sacked for doing so.The Government could change that in an instant if they wanted to. The vast majority of teachers would be greatly relieved not to have to pander to whatever fad is going around.

However, they have more urgent things to deal with. Discipline in schools has plummeted since lockdown and teachers are resigning in droves.

A friend who is a languages teacher came round last night, she left her job as HoD because the behaviour was so dreadful at her school, got a job at a good Catholic school, but it’s just as bad. Both the HoD and deputy have now resigned.

Gender issues affect a small minority of people, I fail to understand why you are so worked up about it. And no, I don’t believe half the tales of woe, you should know how many fantasists are around.

“My daughter is in Year 7. Within the first few months of secondary school, [she] started talking endlessly about her gender identity … She had been taught at school that there are many genders …” Yorkshire.

Across the country, if parental testimonials gathered on the Free to Speak website are to be believed, something profound is occurring in schools under the banner of tolerance and inclusivity. Children are being encouraged to challenge their fundamental biology, to question their sex and the deepest assumptions they have made about their identities. It can be the beginning of a journey leading ultimately to irreversible sex-change surgery. And it is adolescent girls who are most affected.

As one account by Julie, 14, puts it: “Controversial gender ideology has taken over my school. There’s been a rapidly increasing number of teenagers ‘coming out’ as ‘transgender’, entire friend groups suddenly emerging as ‘Non-Binary’ or ‘Gender-Queer’.” Julie describes the phenomenon as a “social contagion”. Teachers, she adds, “are basically encouraging it. Lessons feel more like political activism than education.” Flags in the school hallways bear the mottos “Demiboy” “Asexual” “Non-Binary” and “Polysexual”. Adopting a new “gender identity” is popular in every sense. One girl who “switched her pronouns to he/him, stopped using the girl’s changing rooms and changed her name … and is now essentially a school celebrity. Girls left and right are saying they’re transgender.”",Stoat_Gobbler,2023-04-09,Ireland

How is parents not wanting to know their own children, any different from those who don't want to stop fuelling the war in Ukraine? 

Why doesn't the paper address the real issue - **parents why the hell don't they talk to their children**, get to know them, support them? Or is that too much to ask of them as parents? If they supported them emotionally, maybe they wouldn't want to transition, since mentally they'd be happier because they obviously aren't as things are!

Don't these parents TALK to their kids? What kind of parents are they? They can find the time to breed, but after that it too much trouble to make the effort as parents?

> Often, **parents are wholly unaware** what is going on – sometimes being deliberately kept in the dark if their child adopts a cross-sex identity at school. 

Again don't these parents converse with their own kids?

>  So schools are actively **deceiving parents**.”

So where is the medical support? Shouldn't parents be asking for help for their kids? Of course that implies parents are bothered to take an interest, and actually know their own children. 

> The girls in the study often had something else in common too. Forty-one per cent of those identifying as trangender had previously said they were **not heterosexual; almost two-thirds had been diagnosed with a mental health disorder, with many on the autistic spectrum**.

> Such findings are controversial. But respected studies have found that girls with autism, or who have experienced eating disorders, are much more likely to suffer gender dysphoria and claim a new gender identity. A government review found that about **one-third of children and young people being referred to Tavistock had autism or other neurodiversity**.

So they don't feel at home with women being used as **sex objects**? 

> ""**I was trying to get away from being sexualised**.” 

So basically **parents don't teach their son's how not to treat girls like sex objects**!  So blame it on porn. Where are these parents, when they should be parenting? 

> The list includes trauma, depression, internalised homophobia among those discovering they are gay and, increasingly, **a growing misogyny in our culture, where hardcore pornography is universal and girls face many demands for sex acts they don’t want. In other words, girls who fear the sexual development of their bodies and rebel against it. “Hypersexualisation is the central problem,” says Bentley-Astor. “Being wolf-whistled at when you’re 10.

It wasn’t the students’ fault for being in that class but a system that had passed the buck instead of helping children who needed intensive instruction and foundational skills.

I do notice more small issues than normal, even with ""good"" kids.  Today in homeroom, a student continually argued about taking his project to science.  The science room is next to my room and he has to pass it on his way to his first period class (he also had to pass it to get to my homeroom).  I would not write him a pass because he has four minutes during passing time to walk in, set down his project, and get to his next class.  There's no reason that he needs to interrupt another class.  He grumbled about it the entire 20 minutes of homeroom.

Obviously, this is a small thing, but I have 15 interactions like this a day with kids who don't understand why I won't drop everything to cater to their individual desires.

On the other hand, if they understood what their parents were complaining about, we'd need a lot more school psychiatrists.

Like I have a planned mental health day this week because of how much I'm struggling right now. 

(incoming rant and whatnot)

Yesterday I brought cookies I baked for a teacher friend. And, keep in mind, I already have a snack shelf of granola bars and slim jims that I buy JUST FOR THE KIDS. I teach high school, roughly six classes of about 30 kids. So like they have to make it last a quarter, but when they need a snack they know where to find it. A 17-year-old kid sees the cookies on my desk, grabs them, and is like ""can I have one?"" And I tell him no and to not touch my desk, so he tosses it back down, which results in the cookies cracking (not that it matters to how it tastes but I try to make them nice when I'm giving them away). And I later told him, ""I buy you guys snacks out of my paycheck, I don't get reimbursed for it. Why would you feel entitled to the cookies on my desk?"" And he was just like ""just thought I would ask."" This kid eats a full meal every day in class: two juice boxes, chips, a sandwich, etc. I don't stop them. I also tend to eat during class if I can. Then this happens again in the next class period (without throwing it down) until my teacher friend can stop by to get it. I don't think I would have asked my teachers for food even if I was starving, because that's my responsibility as a high schooler? Or my parents? 

Later, a kid came by to say ""can you get all the work (two weeks worth) I just turned in graded by the end of the day? I have a grade check."" Let me just drop everything I'm doing for you, including teaching others to grade your work that's 21-14 days late. I just don't understand this entitlement and disrespect.

Those particular boys even had their own slogan for how hectic they were. Whenever a teacher reached their limit with them they would laugh at her and say ""You gotta love us!"" while they continued to be rude and disruptive.",Chicken_Butt_Nuggets,2023-01-31,Ireland

Little kids have always been caught running and screaming through the halls, but before COVID it took just a stern look and a firm, ""Get back here and walk!"" to make them look sheepish and turn around and come back.  This is year, there are little kids who will just turn around and yell right back at you, ""Why should I?"" or ""NO!"" and just keep running.  When finally told to stop and faced with a consequence, they will absolutely dissolve into screaming fits and hysterics.  It's beyond what I ever encountered pre-COVID.  It almost feels like night and day.  And the thing is, it's not all the kids.

Speaking strictly from my experience of returning to education during the pandemic (2020-2021 school year), so many of my students have been through traumatic experiences. The signs of trauma we see regularly are exponentially higher than any amount we saw pre-pandemic, and that's saying something. Not to mention the number of children who had to learn how to process adult emotions that were filtered into them after being around their grown-ups full time for almost two years. Adults have a hard enough time handling emotions if we don't know how to do so in healthy ways, so of course, the kids have no clue. It was a traumatic time for a lot of my students. Shoot, it was a traumatic time for everyone. But most of my time is spent now teaching them how to handle their emotions, and that's ok. I knew what I was getting into when I returned. Am I saying the pandemic is the only reason things are the way they are in education now? No. But it would be wrong to pretend it didn't have a part in the puzzle.",elmitchreal,2023-01-31,Ireland

Each school needs to have specific rules and procedures that EVERY student HAS to follow regardless of where they are on school grounds, or which classroom they are in. Every student and every parent/guardian needs to understand the rules and sign a document stating that they understand it. The first time any student decides to disobey the rules there is an automatic 1 week expulsion and the student and their parent/guardian need to go to the district office for a meeting. The second time the student disobeys the rules, there is an automatic 2 week expulsion, and another meeting at the district office. The third time the student disobeys the rules, they are automatically kicked out of school. No questions asked.

You can't really blame students for not taking education seriously when they are seeing IRL that a college degree frequently doesn't pan out.

Teachers also frequently complain they don't make hardly anything, further reinforcing the idea that education is not valuable, and for their teachers, college was really not even worth it.

I also think a lot of adults, particularly younger parents are EXTREMELY jaded against the educational system as a whole. It's outrageous what college costs, and outrageous that employers require it for the things they do.

I wouldn't even say it's just the kids that's pushing them out. I've had rough years with students but I haven't really had a behavior issue in the last five - aside from one or two jackasses. BUT the other pressures have ramped up too - test scores are down, SEL needs to be implemented, PBIS needs to be implemented, parents have been pitted against teachers because we're indoctrinators/groomers/incompetent, politicians have been gleefully limiting our ability to do anything with an eye towards privatizing education, they want us to teach our students the facts, but not if they make anyone uncomfortable, they want literacy rates up but they're taking away teacher libraries, pushing back against LGBTQ+ books... the list goes on for a while.

1. In line with mandatory safeguarding guidance and the law, parents should automatically be informed when a child discloses feelings of gender distress at school, unless there is a compelling reason for them not to be informed. Parents must be central to any further decision making regarding the handling of a child’s gender distress, including social transition or change of name.   
2. No school should facilitate a child’s social transition (the medical intervention in which a child adopts the social and cultural attributes associated with the opposite sex), unless medical advice clearly endorses this as the best and most appropriate action, and unless parents have been fully involved. Where this situation arises, schools should co-operate fully with relevant external agencies within their local authority.   
3. Schools should be required to publish all Relationships, Sex and Health Education (RSHE) material online, and have a clear process in place for parents to raise any concerns. Parents should be given an absolute right to see all RSHE materials their child will be taught at school. If it is not published online, it must be provided to parents on request, without any requirement for the parent to come on to the school premises. All agencies that provide materials to state-funded schools must accept that materials may be provided to parents in this way.  
4.  The Government must urgently commission an indepent review of the teaching of RSHE materials and approach to gender distressed children in schools, with a focus on safeguarding. The review must be independent and not carried out by the Department for Education (DfE) which has been too closely involved in the development of the current situation.   
5. In line with the law and current guidance, certain activities and facilities should be single sex. This relates to toilets, changing rooms and sports of a competitive nature. There should be no exceptions to this.   
6.  The DfE should update Keeping Children Safe in Education to explicitly address issues relating to children with gender distress and gender dysphoria, emphasising the importance of parental involvement in a child’s life. The document’s statement that LGBT is not a safeguarding issue needs to be removed, given the additional vulnerabilities of the current cohort presenting with gender distress   
7.  The Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) must routinely consider schools’ approach to gender-distressed children as part of its inspection of safeguarding protocols. A school’s failure to meet the appropriate standard should be reflected in the grade Ofsted awards the school, and treated with the same seriousness as other safeguarding failures.  
8.  The DfE should issue guidance on what is not appropriate for schools to be teaching children in RSHE at different stages of a child’s education. Gender stereotypes must be effectively challenged in schools, without conflating beliefs about gender identity with sex. Discussion about gender-critical beliefs should be included.   
9. No state-funded school should subscribe to diversity membership schemes offered by external agencies where such organisations are involved in political campaigning. In accordance with the law, subscription to such schemes constitutes a fundamental conflict of interest. This does not prevent schools from purchasing or using external resources where no conflict arises.

Teaching AND Holidays OR Summer OR PE OR Course OR Physical Education,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/38j58s/infj_and_teaching_physical_education/,INFJ and teaching physical education,"Special ed teacher here. PE is competitive to get into....you may want to get other certifications or experiences to help expand your resume. Adaptive Phy. Ed comes to mind, but I'm biased. I've known PE teachers who also taught Health (sex ed, nutrition, etc). Behavior management is HUGE so if you can take any behavior management classes please do. 

Not to sound sexist but my observation through primarily male principals and admin is that a lot of men fast track through a few years of teaching PE, completing their advanced degrees and moving to administration via all their buddies who also coached/played golf with/whatever. I suppose a woman could fast track this way as well but generally I've seen the ""good ol boys"" club do this. It can be frustrating as a woman.  

I agree with other replies that coaching is also great and you can make extra money in addition to your salary doing this. I always enjoyed teaching summer school as by the end of June you may be itching for something to do anyway. 

As far as education in general, affecting the lives of young people can be very rewarding. I never have a boring day at work. I love the problem solving and building relationships with my students and their families. The red tape and politics in education are exhaust me the most and would drive me out of teaching. Building relationships with kids and having respect and trust is something no government can track or qualify with data, recreate with a robot or write curriculum for, as much as they'd like to think so.

Teaching AND Holidays OR Summer OR PE OR Course OR Physical Education,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/wamz32/considering_going_back_to_school_to_teach_pe_in/,Considering going back to school to teach PE in Arizona,"Well I would like to say that teaching physical education generally speaking is a very saturated field and it is difficult to land a job.  Arizona seems like one of those places where teachers are treated like garbage and so it may be very easy to get a job but it may not be a good one due to pay and working conditions.

Is it worth it to go back to school spend all that time and money on a degree in order to teach physical education? You will have to judge I would strongly recommend to reaching out to several physical education teachers in the area and to also get a feel for how easy it is to get a job and if it's worth it.

I don't think wanting to do something different is a midlife crisis I think variety is the spice of life my only warning to you is that I don't really think education is worth the investment.

Tell a bigot ""we'll stop teaching about the racism in history"" and they'll eagerly spread any lie they can to get to that end goal. 

This is the average republican based on them not flooding comment chains to talk about how outraged they are by this, like they do with any other topic they hear about. 

They're always outraged by history, by minorities, by anything getting even remotely less shitty. They're never outraged hy police brutality, they're never outraged by any violence a republican says or does. If anything, they come to the comment sectiona to cheer on, joke about, meme, or mock victims of their own actions.

We call a white supremacist who didn’t actually free any slaves and said he thought blacks couldn’t be jurors, lawyers, doctors or marry white people, “the emancipator.”  He also said he thought there would always be an inferior and superior between the races and he thought the whites should remain the superior one. 

He hated slavery to be fair.  Though he said he would use the slaves in whatever way he could to achieve his main goal which was preservation of the union.  Whether that meant freeing all, freeing none or freeing some and leaving others.  He went with the last option in the emancipation proclamation despite it not freeing any slaves since congress had to do that.

You're supposed to be contracting your muscles long before the arousal gets too high. Kill the bear before it grows up to kill you. If the bear is already big and you wake it up, then jump on it and hold it down before it lands the first blow to your face. Put out the fire before it grows bigger and burns the house down.

If you've gotten to the point where contracting the muscle triggers the PONR, then you weren't using it enough and you allowed yourself to get way too close to the PONR. You let the fire get too big. You sat there and let the bear tear you apart, limb from limb, instead of fighting it when you had the chance.

>Most men that don't have PE have this ability to delay that we don't, the issue is that for them their body do it unconsciously and they can't really explain it except ""think of something else"". For us we have to be self conscious and figure out how to do it.

See, now, I'm one of those guys that used to have severe PE, one pump chump, and after years of practice, I conquered my PE. I learned how to use my body's need to ejaculate, against itself, for my benefit. I can ""last all day long."" I have never ""thought of something else."" In fact, I thought of nothing but the sex. My mind was, and still is, consumed with nothing but the pleasure. Once you learn to tell the difference between orgasmic pleasure, and ejaculatory pleasure, you'll be able to last all day long too.",leokaltoid,2022-09-27,Ireland

I want to give an update about how it is going for me.

Last week I had sex and to be honest it wasn't that great, everytime I don't have sex for a few days I have this fcking performance anxiety coming back even though I have all the means techniques and all this work for the past few month behind me. Plus something came up in my personal life that stressed me up a lot.  

So yeah, I struggled hard not to come but still managed to cross the 5min line by breathing properly and managing my pace. But I couldn't fuck her harder without instantly reaching ponr and could achieve any plateau...

So I was kinda depressed for the past week because like everytime things don't exactly goes as planed I can't think of anything else that what went wrong.

HOWEVER, I had sex yesterday and I kinda had an epiphany, just before it began I said to myself ""Fuck it, even if it's just hard to get to 5min, enjoy those 5min"" and it just went boom, the thing that I was laking to be in control was just this actually.

I focused on her, on how I felt and stopped being scared of my sensation, and suddenly I could cool down efficiently by slowing down and breathing, and I could fuck her as I wanted and especially enjoyed fucking her !

Today again, we fucked at different pace for half an hour without changing position and it was awesome, everything was easy like my body was finally listening when I needed him to cool down and I did the appropriate things.

So all this research and training and work was the baground that gave me the understanding and the tools, now I hoped you guys that try all this to get rid of PE will just have that epiphany that clic and put everything in place and make all that groundwork useful !

I still struggle a bit with missionary though because I can't figure out a way to breath and relax properly, I think it will be my next work and experiment because unfortunately my current partner really like it.


For comparison purpose a few month ago I could only last for a minute on a really good day but often I needed only a few stroke to get to PONR.

A couple of question. You wrote:

`Absolutely don't do Kegel at all if you have hypertonic pelvic floor dysfunctions (deep pelvic pain, pain after urinating or ejaculation), those who have this will know what I'm talking about.`  
I woudn't say I have ""pain"" after ejaculation. But I do feel tighness, esepcially after sex. Would you say I should still do Kegel to strengthen or I that woudn't be beneficial?

It’s so versatile it could work in almost every situation. Teachers and other aides dress in casual clothes? You just look stylish, but not overdressed. Others in professional clothes? You’ll still fit right in. Teachers are posh and don’t really engage with students on the floor/dirty areas? Totally ok. Teachers get very engaged in all activities? Still comfortable enough to move around in. 

Looks sharp but practical. I love it. Long term you way want to invest in some dark pants but I’m sure you can wear some lighter ones too and just give them some extra love if there are stains.

A+ outfit fashion-wise!  however, practicality-wise, i’d change basically every part of the outfit.  especially if you’re working with ages 4-7 but honestly in general in special ed, i’d assume you’re going to have to do a lot of floor sitting, stooping, squatting, etc.  i’d recommend wearing as comfortable of clothes as possible that you don’t mind sweating in & are able to run in if needed.  gotta be ready for the runners you are inevitably going to have to lope after on the job!  lol good luck at the new gig!!! ❤️

Fellow neurodivergent teacher here, most schools for that age are quite relaxed with dress codes (for most places it just needs to be smart looking).

Many french teachers loathe core French. I don't think there is any course that students get less excited about than their mandatory Grade 9 french course. That said, if you can hack it, make it a bit interesting and make sure your students all pass you will have a tremendous amount of freedom in what you do with it. It's 99% classroom management and 1% french education though.

What you are teaching will not impact your salary (i.e. immersion teachers don't earn more or anything like that)

Certainly not a disadvantage. Ph.D's are not very common in the public school system in my experience.

I transitioned out of academia before pursuing my PhD (thank goodness, chasing tenure for decades on stressful temp contracts and never moving according to my will wasn’t for me). 

Anyways, the best thing you can possibly do for this career path is get involved in one of the part-time B Ed programmes for francophones. (UOttawa, Laurentienne, UOF).  You only have to do 2 terms before you can apply for a transitional certificate from the OCT and you can then work as a qualified teacher. You keep doing the coursework part-time, online. And the French as a first language boards will gladly take you as unqualified supply before then. 

A PHD is pretty useless in K-12 in Ontario. I have several colleagues who have one in French as a First. A masters is top of the pay grid. I believe there is a small top-up for a PhD but nothing compared to the Herculean effort that getting one involves. And it won’t make a difference in getting hired. 

Don’t do Core French. It’s a nightmare of classroom management, behavioural issues and disinterested students and parents.

The first of the now more than 20 states to legalize recreational cannabis did so over a decade ago, offering Maryland a host of potential dos and don&#x27;ts.

***



___

In November, Maryland became the 20th state to legalize adult-use recreational cannabis.

Maryland follows states such as Colorado and Washington, which each legalized in 2012. Medical cannabis became available in Maryland in 2017.

“The world of legalized cannabis, it changes daily, and comparing it to what it was in 2014 or 2012, it’s a different world,” said Justin Tepe, a lawyer at Baltimore law firm Goodell DeVries who works with cannabis companies.

“When you look at what a state like California, Colorado, Washington, Oregon, those are the established markets that we can actually look and see: ‘Okay, here are problems that arose that we can try and avoid by starting this differently.’”

Here’s where Maryland is taking cues from other states, and where legislators hope to pave the way.

Getting some recreational dispensaries operating by July 1 is a key part the legislation passed by Maryland’s House of Delegates and making its way through the state Senate as lawmakers hope to avoid illicit sales gaining a foothold in the market like in New York.

Almost two years after passing its equity-focused recreational law, New York opened its first adult-use dispensary and approved licenses for dozens more late last year, but cannabis companies still expressed concern about unlicensed sellers.

Unlicensed retailers have proliferated in New York amid the state's protracted, equity-minded recreational cannabis rollout.

“We know in some illicit markets, we’ve had individuals lace the product with fentanyl and other enhancers that are dangerous,” said Democratic state Sen. Antonio Hayes of Baltimore, a sponsor of the Senate bill that would establish the rules for Maryland’s market.

“Whereas in Maryland, our cannabis industry is monitored from what they call ‘seed to plant.’ There are controls in place to make sure that the plant is free of contaminants and pesticides and other things,” Hayes said. “Not just our medical but our adult use that’s coming in the future.”

A New York City Sheriff's deputy prepares to load items suspected to be cannabis products that were confiscated from an unlicensed shop. (AP)

July 1 is the earliest legal recreational sales could begin in Maryland. Whatever legislators decide, from that date forward people 21 or older will be allowed to have up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis and to grow up to two plants per household.

Maryland lawmakers plan for already-operating medical dispensaries to be able to convert their licenses into joint recreational and medical licenses. A new round of licenses aimed at diversifying the industry would come by Jan. 1, and a third round would be issued after May 1, 2024.

Among the country’s strangest examples of a regulatory gray zone is neighboring Washington, D.C., where voters legalized small amounts of cannabis nine years ago but Congress has banned sales. That’s led to a gray market where businesses “gift” cannabis with the purchase of art, clothing or other items.

When Maryland’s four-year-old medical cannabis industry began, many noted the lack of diversity among the licensees.

While lawmakers have worked to amend that disparity, it’s been a slow process. In order to give diverse applicants more opportunities, Maryland plans to offer new licenses for boutique shops, on-site consumption spaces and business incubator tenants with lower fees and capital requirements.

“We believe that the lower barrier to entry and the lower need for access to capital will bring greater opportunities for minorities and marginalized communities,” Hayes said.

Lawrence Brown, the author of “The Black Butterfly” and research assistant at the Center for Urban Health Equity at Morgan State University, likened the incubator spaces to OpenWorks, a facility in Baltimore where people can cheaply rent microstudios with access to a wide variety of tools.

Some of the expected tax revenue will go toward cannabis licensing training programs and incubator spaces on historically Black college and university campuses.",politicly1,2023-03-28,Ireland

“That I think can just help accelerate inclusion into the industry in tremendous fashion,” Brown said.

Measures meant to promote equity can sometimes backfire. As lawsuits slowed Illinois' recreational cannabis launch, rigid ownership rules kept licensees from replacing investors who bailed. Unlimited entires in Connecticut's license lottery, meanwhile, let large players buy better odds.

In Illinois, where social equity provisions drew a legal challenge, additional equity requirements made it difficult for licensees to replace investors who didn’t want to wait out the litigation.

For the first round of licenses, which are all limited to social equity applicants, Maryland plans to use a lottery system to award standard, micro and incubator licenses.

In Connecticut, the state’s lottery system was taken advantage of by multi-state operators and larger companies that submitted hundreds of entries and received approval for provisional licenses.

“This flies in the face of the intended lottery system, a low-cost entry for social equity applicants,” said Jacquie Cohen Roth, the owner of CannabizMD and Tea Pad, organizations that focus on education and workplace development in the cannabis industry.

One of the ways legislators believe Maryland is setting a new model is through the creation of a Community Reinvestment and Repair Fund, which would receive at least 30% of cannabis sales tax revenue.

The fund would go toward “community-based organizations” in areas determined by the attorney general as “the most impacted by disproportionate enforcement” of cannabis laws before legalization.

While Baltimore is 62% Black and Black residents historically have been disproportionately arrested for marijuana possession, nine of Baltimore's 10 medical cannabis dispensaries are located within or on the edge of the city's ""White L.""

But when it comes to ensuring that those communities also have a foot in the door with the new recreational industry, lawmakers are limited in using race or gender as a factor without a disparity study.

Former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan commissioned such a study in 2017 when lawmakers were pushing to make the state medical cannabis industry more equitable.

Hayes said a new disparity studyis expected to be released this summer. Having the study in hand would allowed for stronger language around diversity, he said, though information from other states helped make up for that.

Maryland’s recreational cannabis bill defines social equity applicants as people who have lived in a disproportionately impacted area for at least five of 10 years before their application, have attended public school in a disproportionately impacted area for at least five years, have attended a four-year higher education institution where at least 40% of students are eligible for a Pell Grant, or meet criteria established by the Office of Social Equity based on future disparity study results.

It does not include people who have been charged with or convicted of a cannabis offense.

Maryland’s planned sales tax on recreational cannabis would begin at 6% and increase by 1% each year until it hits 10% in 2028.

That’s on the lower end compared to other states that have approved taxes on recreational cannabis.

Virginia, which legalized cannabis possession and home cultivation in 2021 but has not yet set up its retail market, for example, had proposed a 21% sales tax. Tepe said taxes that high could push consumers to the black market.

“I think Maryland aptly recognized that yes, there is an opportunity to develop revenues for the state off of the adult-use sales,” Tepe said. “But looking at it as a windfall or a lottery ticket for the state is the absolute wrong way to look at it.”

Some legislators and industry experts want to see more of the sales tax money dedicated to public health education about cannabis. The bill passed by the House allocates 1.5% of that money to the Cannabis Public Health Fund, but Hayes said the Senate is likely to increase that amount.",politicly1,2023-03-28,Ireland

“That I think can just help accelerate inclusion into the industry in tremendous fashion,” Brown said.

Measures meant to promote equity can sometimes backfire. As lawsuits slowed Illinois' recreational cannabis launch, rigid ownership rules kept licensees from replacing investors who bailed. Unlimited entires in Connecticut's license lottery, meanwhile, let large players buy better odds.

In Illinois, where social equity provisions drew a legal challenge, additional equity requirements made it difficult for licensees to replace investors who didn’t want to wait out the litigation.

For the first round of licenses, which are all limited to social equity applicants, Maryland plans to use a lottery system to award standard, micro and incubator licenses.

In Connecticut, the state’s lottery system was taken advantage of by multi-state operators and larger companies that submitted hundreds of entries and received approval for provisional licenses.

“This flies in the face of the intended lottery system, a low-cost entry for social equity applicants,” said Jacquie Cohen Roth, the owner of CannabizMD and Tea Pad, organizations that focus on education and workplace development in the cannabis industry.

One of the ways legislators believe Maryland is setting a new model is through the creation of a Community Reinvestment and Repair Fund, which would receive at least 30% of cannabis sales tax revenue.

The fund would go toward “community-based organizations” in areas determined by the attorney general as “the most impacted by disproportionate enforcement” of cannabis laws before legalization.

While Baltimore is 62% Black and Black residents historically have been disproportionately arrested for marijuana possession, nine of Baltimore's 10 medical cannabis dispensaries are located within or on the edge of the city's ""White L.""

But when it comes to ensuring that those communities also have a foot in the door with the new recreational industry, lawmakers are limited in using race or gender as a factor without a disparity study.

Former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan commissioned such a study in 2017 when lawmakers were pushing to make the state medical cannabis industry more equitable.

Hayes said a new disparity studyis expected to be released this summer. Having the study in hand would allowed for stronger language around diversity, he said, though information from other states helped make up for that.

Maryland’s recreational cannabis bill defines social equity applicants as people who have lived in a disproportionately impacted area for at least five of 10 years before their application, have attended public school in a disproportionately impacted area for at least five years, have attended a four-year higher education institution where at least 40% of students are eligible for a Pell Grant, or meet criteria established by the Office of Social Equity based on future disparity study results.

It does not include people who have been charged with or convicted of a cannabis offense.

Maryland’s planned sales tax on recreational cannabis would begin at 6% and increase by 1% each year until it hits 10% in 2028.

That’s on the lower end compared to other states that have approved taxes on recreational cannabis.

Virginia, which legalized cannabis possession and home cultivation in 2021 but has not yet set up its retail market, for example, had proposed a 21% sales tax. Tepe said taxes that high could push consumers to the black market.

“I think Maryland aptly recognized that yes, there is an opportunity to develop revenues for the state off of the adult-use sales,” Tepe said. “But looking at it as a windfall or a lottery ticket for the state is the absolute wrong way to look at it.”

Some legislators and industry experts want to see more of the sales tax money dedicated to public health education about cannabis. The bill passed by the House allocates 1.5% of that money to the Cannabis Public Health Fund, but Hayes said the Senate is likely to increase that amount.",politicly1,2023-03-28,Ireland

I was awarded an undergraduate degree in Pre-17th Century English Literature, but I went on to get an MBA, later. The writing and other skills I acquired were the foundation of my first business; later, statistics, Toyota Production Method, and other specialities helped bolster my overall entrepreneurial endeavors -- including finance, analyzing P&L/balance sheets, etc.

Frankly, I learned accounting from my gf at the time (who was a business major) when I launched my first business... however, later on, after graduate school, I applied virtually everything I learned --including micro AND macro economics, marketing, etc. Micro: pricing strategies; macro: aided in my need for FOREX management.

Will an undergraduate in business help you to become a better business owner? Hmmm, I don't know. For me, being a better ""manager"" of people, projects... helped. You could learn those skills many different ways. 

My advice to my kids has always been: study what interests you at university, so you apply yourself and really capture the value of the university system (exposure to a wide variety of ideas, people, etc.). I would never recommend someone learn specific programming languages at university, precisely because they go out of date. Learn computer science. Same with any other area of study: history can yield immense knowledge and wisdom, if you have the desire to learn it. 
University is less about job skills, more about knowledge and learning to... learn and grow, as a person.

Accounting will teach you how to keep proper records in your business. Finance is the language of money and business. The two are complimentary.

As for the rest, those courses will all be the most beneficial if you have an idea of what you want to do for your business. The material will be more relevant (and thus memorable) to you.

If you don’t know what you want to do, but you know what field of business you want to focus on (finance, marketing, operations, information systems, etc), your concentration in those subjects is meant to give you broad enough knowledge of the topic so that you might find a niche to focus on.

However, if it’s just knowledge about business that you seek…a library card can probably fill you up with that knowledge far cheaper than a university.

But university (for the smart student) can/should be more than just classes. It’s the best opportunity to network and expand your social circle you will ever have. Let’s say you want to be in the insurance business…get to know EVERYONE in your business program because they are all most likely future clients.

Or would I learn more teaching myself and starting my first company now?,"I've sat in on first-year business classes at universities now and then, and the general impression I've gotten is:

- Accounting classes: Good. Accounting has been using double-entry bookkeeping for 700 years and a lot of the same terminology for well over a century. Accounting 101 hasn't changed much in that time and there should be no surprises. If you can do it on paper, most accounting software will be exactly the same thing but on a screen.

- Management classes: Variable. Management depends a lot on people skills and the local culture and how it's changed in the last 5 years. Any management class largely written 10-20 years ago (which is most of them) is going to be woefully out of date and will only be of use if you're going to hire your grandparents. At best it will tell you about how management used to be done. There will be almost zero acknowledgement of anything recent like the huge WFH push or how to manage remote staff.

- Marketing: Similarly variable. There are certain traits which have been the same for thousands of years, and have been markedly (ha) more sharpened in the last few decades; things like the psychology of marketing. Like acceptable management, it will also depend on your local culture - a marketing tactic which may work well in one country, field, or demographic may flop horribly in another. Learn about the underlying basics: what marketing is for, where it fits into the business, the difference between marketing and sales, how marketing works in small companies vs large ones, and so on. Don't take on board the highly specific examples and think you can replicate them; by the time you finish your course they'll be out-of-date relics, even assuming they weren't already. The general rule of thumb is: if you push your marketing into people's faces, they will reject it and hate you. If you set it up so they feel they've discovered it themselves, they're more likely to feel in control and maybe want to look deeper. In modern terms, it's no use getting ten million clicks force-funneled to your site if no-one wants to be there. You want the ten clicks where people are on your site because they have a reason to be there and are already looking to buy.

- How to understand and work with specialist workers in this or that area: crap. In particular, any technical industries will change so fast that if you take away buzzwords and technical understanding from these classes, all you'll be doing is revealing to said workers that you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about and you'll sound like an insane caveman. Stick to talking in terms of time and money, and let the specialists tell you about the things they're working with this week as they feel the need to; you can always Google them later to bring yourself up to speed.",Geminii27,2022-10-13,Ireland

At its core a business is just providing a service or good for more than what it cost you to do, purchase, or create.

I own a company that does millions of dollars in sales per year that I started with $2000 and they all work for other people. All my entrepreneur friends didn’t really study business in school. Sales and execution are essential focuses. Can you perform the service or deliver the product you’re selling. Mindset is the most important thing.

I'm not trying to be snide, I'm arguing back against those that say you don't need to learn how to run a business before getting into business for yourself. Then again, I also tell people the stupidest advice I hear is when people tell others to go out and make mistakes and just learn from them.

To me, it's so much smarter to watch others make mistakes and learn from their mistakes. To wit, do I really need to get drunk and crash a car to learn it's a bad idea or can I see the results of what someone else did and learn the lesson without the pain and expense?

I've owned a very successful business for the last 28 years that helps other business owners make a ton of revenue. How did I learn to do that? Well, everyone in my extended family started and owned their own business. Some were small businesses like a small store and others were larger all the way up to a hospital, health insurance corporation, and an international travel company. I grew up around them and even working in a few. This gave me a mind for business.

I then went to college for 9 years and studied everything about business you can imagine. Did I take a lot of useless classes? Unfortunately, like everyone else, I did. But I also took some amazing classes and the following is a list of some that I use the info from frequently.

* Accounting (and especially Quickbooks if you can find a class on it).
* Business Law
* Marketing (I'm a marketer so I took tons of these classes)
* Sales
* Management Relations
* Economics
* Business computing (basically all your office apps).
* Database applications
* Speech
* Writing (business letter writing especially)
* Philosophy (just kidding)

You will never regret the education if you go to a good school. That said, I do NOT believe a four-year education is necessary if you're not going to own your own business.

You need a working knowledge of all of them, and preferably the working capital to hire experts to do the ones you do not know. You are nearly always better to subcontract rather than hire a full time person for those hire out at first, though they can be pulled in house as profits increase

1.  Accounting and compliance.  I have done this with and without an accountant.... the accountant was expensive, but not as expensive as not hiring one. Have had businesses go under due to poor accounting. 

2.  Marketing.  Nobody is good enough to launch without getting the word out. Nobody has business good enough to not need a pipeline of new customers. The one exception is if you have a business that cant really be sold and nearing retirement. Have a therapist as a client who has stopped all advertisement because they are past retirement age and want to slow down. They have more business than they actually want right now from organic referrals. You are a long way from that...so keep the pipeline open.  If you are busy there are ways to keep your business visible without creating urgency to buy immediately. It seems like a waste of money, but it is not. 

3.  Vision statement. Traditionally if you saw these from large corporations, they look like garbage. They kind of were. What does need to happen is take as much time as you need to have a clear vision of 

1.  Who your customers are
2.  What will you be providing to them
3.  How does this make their lives better
4.  How do you provide this (ie secure your supply lines, treat employees very well to get them to perform well. Etc. Find how your model may break and do everything in your power to keep it healthy)
5.  What are your values. How business is done is often a differentiator to customers. Make company culture a deliberately crafted thing rather than chase dollars exclusively. If culture is not paid attention to, it usually ends up toxic with enough employees/time.

I too am from ottawa. I took business marketing and business admin. I was the same age. I have gone on to start several million + a year companies in the 613. 

Now that we have my credentials out of the way, here’s my advice. 

1. Marketing. If you don’t have clients, you don’t have ANYTHING. Much less accounting problems or admin problems. If I were you (I was), I would just do the marketing program. Make sure you know how to read a balance sheet and a P/L statement. You don’t need more accounting than that unless you want to spend your time doing the accounting. If you start a good business with plenty of sales due to your quality marketing, you can hire a book keeper within a few months of starting. Just keep your receipts organized. 

2. Buy some online courses on SEO and SEM (Google ads). If you’re selling products, learn Facebook ads. 

School will teach you the fundamentals of marketing and business, but the material is about 10 years behind. 

-skipping college-
You certainly could and you would likely learn more by just starting your business.  However, you could repeat the same fundamental mistakes of marketing over and over for years due to not understanding fundamentals such as the 4/5Ps, what a brand character is or many other important marketing fundamentals. You would also miss out on how to create a trustworthy brand and get into people’s hearts and homes. College / university is also about making connections that you will tap i to for the rest of your life (teachers mentors and classmates).

My advice is do a 2 year marketing program while you build your idea. I am very glad I took marketing. All the other programs I took (3) I could have done without. 

Ottawa and Canada, more generally speaking, due to its stability(questionable these days) and support systems/ organizations is one of the best places to start a business. Enjoy the journey

I got my MBA and started a business after. The MBA was really helpful. Most of the MBA topics were similar to the undergraduate degree, there were just more cases and group work, plus I had a thesis.

What I can tell you is the focus of a business degree is not entrepreneurial. It is on things like strategy, marketing, accounting, organizational behavior…. It’s aimed at people working in management. I did take an entrepreneurship course and one on venture capital, which were helpful, but it’s all book knowledge. It’s a bit like playing a sport like football and studying formations and past games in the classroom.

What do you think they teach in high school? Introductory level course. If anything even less than introductory level courses. Ap bio and Ap physics correlates to introductory physics courses in college. Even if you're doing AP level courses, you're still doing introductory courses. Even calculus is an introductory course. Upper level math is nothing like calculus. 

>Furthermore, some courses that are typically taught in college should be added to the high school curriculum - namely, intro to psychology, intro to statistics, and intro to economics. I believe that teaching these subjects in high school would greatly benefit our society.

First of all, all of those are available in a good high school. Second, with respect to economics and stats, those require calculus in the first place. The high school version of these classes are just rote memorization. You don't get to call those rote memorization classes useful but then call the foundational knowledge to them (calculus) useless. No economist nor statistician calls themselves that without knowing calculus.",fatgamornurd,2023-03-16,Ireland

Your options if you want to be a teacher are either do the MTeach or do another whole Bachelors. It's obviously a no brainer to do the shorter MTeach and you will not be overqualified or unemployable at all.   

With regards to your teaching areas this may differ depending on which state you plan to teach in. In Victoria you would have two options. The first would be to complete the MTeach with two science areas, then get yourself a job and put your hand up to teach English. What you can teach in a school is not necessarily limited by what subjects you are qualified for, it's ultimately up to your principal. So they may allow you to do that if it suits their scheduling. (Side note, I am a science teacher and would never personally do this because the marking load of English teachers is ridiculous, but that's me!)     

The second option is to do some tertiary English subjects before your MTeach, as unis will only allow you to specialise in areas that you've done some tertiary study in. You'd need to talk to your chosen uni about how to meet this benchmark.",Pondglow,2023-03-18,Ireland

Check with the uni to fond out the exact requirments for a subject as it can often be a case of only having to do one or two extra units to qualify.

The current day 40 hour work week is the same model as feudal Europe, American plantation and the concept of slave gardens and personal residences on the company property- it’s just been exploded - instead of a shack on the plantation field, we have 2 bedroom condos in a neighborhood of like workers. Instead of slave garden we have Whole Foods and hobbies. 

So here’s the rub. What was life expectancy and quality of life for slaves in the south or for indentured servants in Europe?

Yes we are still slaves. No doubt.

But godamn has our environment and quality of life improved- as has our opportunity to earn freedom.

If you look at the world like this, you see that most people have always been slaves - through all of history, but let’s take a snapshot of the last thousand years and look at the trajectory of quality of life and life expectancy for the slaves

We are in a major uptrend. Seems to imply that the ship is headed for fairer waters for all the occupants, captains generals and crew men. 

If our trajectory keeps constant, we will continue to improve life expectancy and quality for all men, slave and master alike.

And based on the trajectory - the most able men and minds will only have increased opportunity to free themselves and their families as we progress - specifically as we progress with technology- which has been our light and savior since the ancient days. 

AI, quantum computing and transfer of value at light speed will change the world so drastically over the next ten years, that the following 50 will see major adjustments to quality of life for the least economically privileged among us. 

What will happen when computers can do 70% of all white and blue collar jobs? 

Eventually that liberates all men from the mire. 

Admittedly- we will live to see some rocky adjustment periods before we get to the benefit, but we may see the benefit sooner than we think with how things are moving exponentially

Teaching AND Holidays OR Summer OR PE OR Course OR Physical Education,https://www.foxnews.com/media/parents-dream-school-district-become-woke-nightmare-jokes,Iowa school district under fire after board member says public education is not to teach kids 'what parents want',"When I (40) was in 6th grade I remember there was a big controversy at my school. Several parents didn't like the curriculum for the sex ed class. They pulled their kids from that class and instead had the summer drivers Ed instructor teach those students his version of sex ed. (he was able to take a class quick to be qualified) The school board was bullied into allowing it.

 Only kids in that grade that became parents during high school were from that group that took the parents version of sex ed. 

From time to time I run into that drivers Ed instructor and all he does is complain about kids using litter boxes in school. I'm so happy he had moved on when I took drivers Ed.

My Mother was a Special Education teacher and Consultant during her career and it would amaze me the stories she would tell at home about parents and Principals/Superintendents that had no Special Ed qualifications just completely derailing a students teaching plan.",IAFarmLife,2023-01-28,Ireland

If a parent came into my room and told me I can't teach certain things from certain cultures, I would tell them that I've heard their opinion and take it into consideration and then totally disregard it.

Teaching AND Holidays OR Summer OR PE OR Course OR Physical Education,https://www.foxnews.com/media/parents-dream-school-district-become-woke-nightmare-jokes,Iowa school district under fire after board member says public education is not to teach kids 'what parents want',"This is the real reason these parents want to ban everything. They don’t want to parent. It’s fine for a parent to try to pass on their values and beliefs to their kids, it’s normal. But that means teaching those things to your kids so they can apply that framework to the world around them, not hiding the world around them so you can be a lazy fuck. 

It’s not the school or public’s job to enforce the morals of parents. Children should be allowed to learn things that are real and true and parents should be allowed to help them interpret those things. But not these parents, they want all the work done for them. And for what? They won’t be kids forever and they’re gonna find out about gay people and trans people and history and all the things they want to hide. Only this way, they won’t have any of the skills they need to understand those things within the context of the values their parents are claiming to hold. It will be abstract to them and it probably won’t go how the parents want it to.

And what fucking right do these parents have to deprive all children of the rich and complex world around them? Why do they get to dictate what someone else’s kid learns? If they’re so worried, homeschool. But they won’t because they’re lazy and dumb and don’t want to be parents if they have to do any work.",I_madeusay_underwear,2023-01-29,Ireland

If that's not helpful or not an option you gotta look at each kid's IEP and see what they need. Is the reason they can't do the math because they get numbers mixed up? Because they don't understand the question? Do they struggle with the calculation portion? Looking for resources online to approach each student's individual needs can lead to a much more successful student and make you a better teacher.

Also, if you haven't already look into universal design for learning (UDL). TL;DR we have a super one size fits all school structure that simply isn't working for a lot of kids. If you can modify the ways students are receiving the lesson and communicating their learning (and giving students options in how they learn and share their learning), far more students will be successful. 

SPED is often just better, clearer teaching. If you can master these techniques they will help ALL your students. Every brain in our classrooms is different and our lessons should be flexible to meet the needs of our students.

This stuff is really hard, but once I started to learn more about SPED I really saw a lot of my students do so much better.

I suppose it depends on exactly what requirements your district has for your curriculum.

We have been very successful at incorporating inclusion students into our physics courses, but our curriculum is based entirely on NGSS and heavily concept-based. We hit important mathematical points and focus on the relationships that the equations represent over ""math puzzle""-type problems. (I've got nothing against ""math puzzle"" problems, personally; I wouldn't have majored in physics if I didn't enjoy them, but they are absolutely a barrier to inclusion for your general level high schooler, let alone your special ed students.)

Some things I do/have done in my classroom with all my students that make it very accessible for my sped students:

- Concept checks. Single concept check-ins graded on a 3 point scale. Students are supposed to revise their answers until they demonstrate a level 3 answer. So: I give out the concept check, they respond. I give it a number on the scale 1, 2, or 3 and record the grade in my gradebook. I give the concept check back, and they redo their answer. Repeat until they can get a 3. (The new number supercedes their old grade.) Since I don't spend a lot of time giving individual feedback, these are meant to have quick turnaround. I get to focus my help on the kids that need it the most, as demonstrated by their inability to independently get a 3 on the check. They have a record of exactly which concepts we have worked on and their track record at being able to answer questions about it. For quizzes, I can then say (for example): Tomorrow's quiz will cover material from concept checks 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 and the students have no excuse to not know which topics they are expected to know.

- Point recovery applications. On larger unit tests, they can earn credit back on questions they missed by explaining *why* their answer was wrong, what the answer should be, and giving a generalized explanation of the topic the question addresses. They are not guaranteed credit just for handing something in as I have to be convinced they actually learned something by their explanation. I have given up to full credit back, but it can also be for some maximum partial credit if that works better in an overall grading system. This works better with open ended questions, generally. It sounds like a bear to grade, but I have them do each question on a separate form and staple them to the back of their tests. It's actually not bad to flip through quickly.",myheartisstillracing,2021-08-12,Ireland

This study is evaluating an approach, and showing there seems to be a measurable effect that stays.

This has some renewed importance as:

1. It's one thing to say kids aren't acting right, but everyone has an opinion on how to fix it. Some have history on their side, some have extrapolation and wishful thinking, some emotion and some a religious text. Ideally we want approaches based on tools that work, not just that we think should work, lest they become mods.


2. We are basically tasking teachers and society with aspects of raising children that aren't receiving these skill lessons at home for a variety of reasons.

It is unfair to expect someone with difficulties with impulse control to sit through something and label them as “bad” or whatever for it. Every single human has different sensory needs and has/needs different skills to better focus on any of the diverse set of tasks that exist. 

For example I struggled greatly through k-12 education, I was denied every step of the way opportunities to explore my sensory needs (at home and I’m school). As it turns out I do much better in almost every academic situation if I’m able to hold something with a little weight/I’m using a weighted blanket. These things are regulating to me because they challenge my body, allowing it to be calm while my mind focuses on something. For students that I teach it can be having access to ice cold water to drink through a straw, exercise throughout the day, having shoes and socks off, stimming, wearing headphones, listening to wordless calm music, darkened rooms, seeking squeezes on arms/legs/head/ect. 


I could go on and on and on about tools we can use to help self regulate, and to help co-regulate before self regulation has been reached. But the point is that its an important tool in education, it’s often overlooked in Typical schooling, I’m sure much more egregiously in the US than most of the western world. Overall, we don’t view self regulation techniques as valuable and mature things to do- for literally no reason other than it wouldn’t be heavy duty workplace safe and most of our public k-12 education system is designed around the idea that after school we should go to work in a factory. But I think it’s a good thing for children and adults to have access to any variety of regulation techniques in school and the workplace. 

Anyways, the change from stopping stimming and other self regulation in special education is fairly new, I think adopted in the past decade/half-decade, there is a growing focus on building regulation tactics that are functional, healthy, and safe. I’m happy that special needs children are getting the self regulation skills education they need, and I really do hope to see this adopted in k-12 education, and through that have tangible self regulation tools de-stigmatized in our adult society.",cumulonimbusted,2022-10-22,Ireland

Therapists actually work with their clients on self-regulation, and delayed gratification, in order to support mental health goals. 

And quite frankly, we can’t start by just teaching self-regulation. Beforehand you already have to be good at identifying your feelings, expressing them through language, identifying how they physically feel in your body, and what external forces paired with internal cognitions and self-image brought those feelings about.

I also recommend his book ""Free to Learn"".

> play is a major vehicle for children’s overcoming narcissism, learning to attend to others’ needs, and learning to create their
own activities. Also consistent with the view that play promotes self-control and creative thinking are a study showing that children who had more free time to play scored better on a test of self-directed executive processing than did those whose time was more fully structured by adults.

This is a consistent finding across science.  Children who are given more autonomy and have more time to play (especially in mixed age groups) are better at self-regulation.  We don't need to teach children self-regulation, we don't need more teaching, teaching is the problem, not the solution.  We need more play, especially in mixed-age groups and with minimal adult supervision.  

> [Group] Play is always an exercise in self-restraint.  

Kids need to follow rules to keep the game going and to get along with the group, they need to control their own desires in order to keep the game going with the whole group.  Parents/teachers can't help with this, in fact they are generally actively harmful if they participate.

The problem is not overly permissive parents, it's helicopter parents, schools and teachers focused on academics and cutting back on unstructured play (most play at schools is not unstructured) and parents who are more concerned with their kids learning to count to 10 by age 4 than they are with finding regular time and opportunity for their kid to play with other kids.",zykarii,2022-10-22,Ireland
