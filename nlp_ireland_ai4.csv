At the end of the day any university degree is more valuable to an employer than the best IT degree. The programs are very good, and it has a very nice riverside campus. It’s a far nicer looking place than NUIG.

I’d avoid LIT. Academically it’s fine, but it’s very close to Moyross, one of limerick’s crime hotspots, and there’s very little going on in the area. If Galway is your benchmark, LIT will fall short.",tychocaine,2019-05-26,Ireland

Ball called held up as the final play. Complete drama!

A great but by no means classic. 'Rock did their best Ireland impression and camped in the opposition 22 before getting turned over on 2 separate occasions. 

Tom Roche the rock full back  the big talking point for me. 

Complete howler in defence gave belvo the only try of the match. Threw 2 offloads to no one and dropped 2 crucial balls. 

Very promising attacker. Poor in the other areas. 

Side note, the haircut standards in blackrock have slipped a lot since I left. If I showed up to school with a mop like that of have been sent home ha",arsebiscuits1,2017-03-17,Ireland

I hope you all enjoy ireland and the rugby.

Yes ticket master is your best bet. 
Yes, you can usually buy tickets from scalpers outside the stadium. They’ll be expensive and possibly fake.
Yes, you can buy tickets on secondary markets. 

 But before you begin all that, a suggestion; it might actually be worth a try ringing the branch (Leinster rugby) directly, tell them your situation and they might actually help you out. They can be very considerate when it comes to situations like this. They’re trying to spread the brand etc and Leinster are a very America-friendly brand. 

If none of the above work and you find yourself in Dublin on game day, go down to Aviva and stop the first garda (police) you see close to the stadium. They’ll be wearing high vis vests. Tell them your situation and ask where you can get tickets. They’re is a high chance that they’ll have tickets and give them you. Not widely known but they often confiscate them from the scalpers and give them out to kids and families for free. 

You should right s review of the trip and post it here. It’d be great to hear how you get on. ",Roanokian,2019-01-25,Ireland

I'd actually be interested to see how that goes. I remember our school played a touring American high school, was a little one sided but they showed plenty of potential. Nice guys too. Too bad you lads come on the 21st as on the 17th (St Patricks Day) the Leinster SCT final is on.

The Aviva is a huge stadium and didn't sell out for either the semi or the quarter last year. It got pretty close 51k and 48k out of just under 53k capacity AFAIK. 

Looking at Leinster rugby twitter, they only sold 40k tickets by March 14th. Now, don't get me wrong. Ulster will have a lot more fans there than sarries did. And we only have 2 home 6 nations games this year (and they're very hard to get tickets to), and there is more hype. So I fully expect this game to sell out, and quickly, but if you're ready when they go on sale next week I think you'll get as many as you need. 

To be safe you could also ask either Terenure or Coolmine if they get an allocation. ",errlloyd,2019-01-24,Ireland
