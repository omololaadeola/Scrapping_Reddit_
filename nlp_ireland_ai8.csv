>New Jersey certification is required for any professional staff member employed in New Jersey public schools or in any institution under the supervision of the New Jersey Department of Education, including charter schools and educational facilities within the Department of Corrections, Juvenile Justice Commission and the Department of Human Services.


>CE - The Certificate of Eligibility (CE) is a credential with lifetime validity issued to an individual who has NOT completed a teacher preparation program, but who has met the basic requirements for certification including academic study and applicable test requirements. The CE authorizes an individual to seek and accept employment in NJ public schools requiring certification.

Here is the document with CE requirements:

https://nj.gov/education/license/endorsements/1630CE.pdf


>Degree Requirement
• A minimum of a bachelor’s degree is required from a regionally accredited college/university.


>Cumulative GPA Requirement
• New Jersey requires that candidates for certification achieve a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 when a GPA of 4.00 equals an A grade for students graduating on or after September 1, 2016 (2.75 for those graduating before September 1, 2016) in a baccalaureate degree program, higher degree program or a State-approved post-
baccalaureate certification program with a minimum of 13 semester-hour credits. 

>• Please note that there are GPA Flexibility Rules where a high praxis score may offset a GPA that is lower than 3.0, but higher than 2.75.


>Subject Matter Preparation
• For certification as a Physical Education teacher, current regulations require that applicants complete a minimum of 30 credits in a coherent sequence in the subject field of Physical Education. A coherent sequence requires that at least 12 credits are completed at the advanced level of study (junior, senior or graduate level). Examples of courses 
accepted for physical education include: fundamental skills and exercises, gymnastics, individual sports, dual sports, 
team sports, golf, tennis and basketball. Related courses may be accepted depending on the course 
description/content. Please provide a course description if a course is not taken from the Physical Education 
Department. Courses in pedagogy/education are not accepted towards the subject matter preparation. The final determination as to which courses will be counted towards the Physical Education subject matter is based on professional and content standards found in the NJ Licensing Code. All credits must appear on a regionally accredited 2 or 4 year college/university transcript.


>Testing Requirements
• Praxis II Test Requirement
Official scores must be presented directly from Educational Testing Service to the NJ Department of Education. Only official scores are accepted. The New Jersey Department of Education code (R7666) and your Social Security 
number must appear on your test score report in order to be accepted. Please submit a copy of your test score report if you have taken the appropriate exam. 

>Basic Skills Assessment Requirement (choose one)
All candidates applying for their initial CE must pass Commissioner-approved test of basic skills. Scores must be 
presented directly from Educational Testing Service to the NJ Department of Education. Only official scores are 
accepted. The New Jersey Department of Education code (R7666) and your Social Security number must appear on your test score report in order to be accepted. Please submit a copy of your test score report if you have taken the appropriate exams.
OR
Score in the top one-third percentile on the SAT, ACT, or GRE for the year the test was taken. Official score reports 
must be sent directly from the testing agency.

For example, climbing was added to the Olympics for the first time in Tokyo, and because it was an ""experimental"" event, it was only given one set of medals to award.

The International Sport Climbing Federation (IFSC) typically has 3 events: Speed, Lead, and Boulder. While Lead and Boulder have substantial overlap, Speed is almost entirely a different sport.

The IFSC wanted to continue to showcase all three disciplines (in large part because Speed looks very cool to new viewers), but also did not want to create a competition format where speed climbers automatically lose. Therefore, adding points together doesn't work.

The format they went with was a multiplicative, less-is-better system. An athlete's ranking after three events is multiplied together, and the lowest score wins. 

For example, if you placed 3rd in speed, 4th in lead and 4th boulder your score would be 3 * 4 * 4=48. Meanwhile, if you placed 1st in Speed, 6th in lead and 6th in boulder, your score would be 1 * 6 * 6 = 36. Therefore, winning a competition and just not sucking in other competitions is better than doing OK in all three. This rewards specialists with some amount of transferability. 

Change this to an additive system, and you end up rewarding generalists instead. 

So to answer this question, you must define how scores are combined.",far_257,2022-09-21,Ireland

So I don't support banning anyone from something for their identity, but what's the actual solution here?

A trans woman does have a degree of unfair advantage in women's sports, and a trans man has a degree of unfair disadvantage in men's sports. Yes, I'm aware that hormone replacements help, but there is still a difference on a genetic level that is ultimately unfair.

However, forcing them to compete within their own ""genetic bracket"" is also unfair, and puts their dignity at risk (a woman being forced to change and shower in a room full of men, for example). 

You could do a Trans League, sure. But it would be to women's sports as women's sports are to men's in terms of popularity, or at least I'd assume so, which would cause funding and pay problems.

How do you make it fair and dignified for everyone? Again this isn't me being a shithead (for once), I genuinely don't know how you'd go about untangling all of this.

Summer camps are such a great opportunity for kids.  We should expand the number of them and access to them, but I don’t think the path to equity is subtracting wonderful experiences that we aren’t doing a good job of providing broad access to.  I also think we’ve sucked too much joy, freedom and creativity and outdoor time out of school.  Don’t even get me started on start times before 8AM.   A good long break is a good thing.  I do like the idea of courses cycling, but logistically don’t k is how that could work in practice.

My five point plan:

1.  At the elementary level, class caps of 12 in any school that centers RJ, trauma informed practice and/or a policy of meeting the needs of all students within their classrooms.  These can only work and successfully co-exist with academic goals if the groups are small enough.  

2.  Schools must adjust response to deliberately hurtful student actions to protect physical and psychological harm to other students and staff.  Expecting staff to just try to de-escalate someone when a student is regularly trying to embarrass or intimidate them is not a reasonable expectation on its face, but it additionally encourages mimicry of those behaviors by others and harms bystanders.  It seems to me that too many classrooms have become similar to homes in which kids witness, and are helpless to stop, domestic violence.  I am not a fan of punitive discipline, but I do believe that it is appropriate, necessary and logical to maintain classrooms in which kids are not trying to be invisible as a form of self-protection. We need to stop being a source of daily trauma.

3.  At least ten percent of the week with students has to be completely under teacher discretion as long as a teacher can articulate the academic or social-emotional benefits of their choices.

4.  Feasibility analysis for all policies and initiatives. Schools cannot put in place what cannot be consistently staffed at the levels needed for success.  Assigned tasks must be plausible to accomplish (at a level that would be deemed competent and proficient) without an expectation of consistent evening and weekend work.

5.  Public money cannot be shifted to private education.  Public schools need every dollar.

Much bigger investment in education. Higher teacher pay, and higher standards for teachers to match.

2. No middle or high school can legally start before 8:30am

3. Classes capped at 15

4. Get rid of grade inflation and just pushing people through so we don’t have bad graduation rates. If you don’t know the material, you don’t pass the class. Provide supports to help the kids get through it, but don’t just hand it to them. Likewise, don’t hold higher achieving kids back - my friend’s district has a policy against honors classes, screw that let the top kids achieve their potential and push them more. Our standards are so low and we need to raise them

5. Stop the bureaucratic bullshit that’s just a waste of time. Stop letting people with little to no experience in education run things and make decisions.",[deleted],2023-02-04,Ireland

Then that depth of skill compared to then is what causes the talent at the top to be even better because iron sharpens iron. Then, at heavyweight especially, the fighters are getting bigger while retaining that skill like Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua and if you have a huge size advantage with comparable skill you win most of the time. That being said could Joe Louis or Sugar Ray Robinson be transplanted in this era and be world champs probably because they're talented and athletic and pioneers of the modern style.

From reading your description, I’d pick Rice for sure.

It’s almost open, especially someone like you who have multiple interests) and also known to be a school that’s very collaborative and supportive.

Without voltage you have no current, he says as much when discussing the potential difference and how electrons won’t flow without one. 

These kind of comment propagate a misunderstanding of the three way relationship between voltage resistance and current. Current is a result of the first two. As such, it’s the combination of voltage and resistance, resulting in a current flow large enough to cause damage that kills you.",testa12,2023-01-29,Ireland

I'm wondering because most of my lifting is 8-12 reps for 3 sets, but at a weight where it's ""to failure"" i.e. I wouldn't be able to get a rep more.

Also I'm kind of plateau'd on my pull-ups. I can get two sets of 10 unweighted pull-ups, and I do that twice a week.

First off, thank you for sharing your journey! This is incredibly helpful and inspiring. 

I guess I have a few questions for you.

I had honestly never heard of Coffinworm before, so I had to go read up on it a bit. I read that a part of the program is supplemental 5x5 work at 70%TM, but it looks like you only do weighted pull up work on Mondays. Did you try the 5x5 and just decided it was too much to recover from? Do you like the low volume approach better than high volume workouts like Thenx? And how conservative are you with your TM - how many reps do you expect to hit on your 100% TM set? 

My only weighted pull up work is on Tuesdays and just some greasing-the-groove work on a pull up bar at home. I’m considering adding some additional pull up volume on Fridays which is primarily a leg day, although I have chest-supported rows programmed afterward. I’m thinking this could be a good spot to do burnout sets with BW, maybe some other basic stuff I never would have considered without reading this post, like negatives or Australians.

Appreciate all the effort you put in to this post! This is like a Bible for someone like me, being similar in stature, and having a similar starting point. You got me motivated as hell to join you in the 2xBW club. Hopefully I’ll see you there soon!",income_potent,2023-03-23,Ireland

His opponent, a tough Brazilian from Nova Uniao, had taken his back, with both hooks in.  The only thing stopping a finish by RNC was his desperately tucked chin.  To compound matters, he was down 2 points to 6 with scarcely a minute left.  Things were looking bleak indeed.

“If I could hand fight,” he thought, “I might throw off the choke and get to turtle.  From there I might be able to recover guard and get some kind of sweep.”  As these thoughts flashed into his brain, he now heard his opponent’s coach: “Termine esse idiota!”  Though Peyton spoke not a word of Portuguese, he somehow understood every syllable.  All his senses were inflamed.  Now feeling himself being rolled over as if in slow motion, he was hyperaware of the scoreboard clock, the glow of the numbers and the angular shape of every digit.  He perceived every tick like the knell of a gong.

Peyton was a 4-stripe purple belt, a good one.  And like many BJJ practitioners, he was not averse to the occasional psychedelic experience.  But never had he combined these experiences--until today.  He had taken shrooms before weigh-ins.

Though in the iron grasp of his opponent, Peyton was now also in the velvet grip of the divine.  His opponent’s wiry forearm had sunken from his chin onto his throat, and he was feeling the sharp pressure of imminent suffocation.  But with transcendent sensitivity, he perceived himself hovering in the very air above the mat, seeing his position with complete precision.  He felt completely sentient.  To tap in the quarterfinals seemed preposterous.  “To lose on points, that’s not so bad, but to be choked out, hoje nao”, he thought.  With supreme effort he managed to interpose one hand between his neck and his opponent’s forearm, and next managed to kick out one leg, freeing himself of a hook.  With instant comprehension of the reversing tide, Peyton managed to turn onto all fours, grab his opponent’s lapel and rise to his feet, all in one sudden motion.

Peyton was hyperaware of the position of every limb, never had he felt such a feeling of perfect coordination and cognition.  Moreover, his soul had transcended the instant match.  He was at unity and peace with the attendees, the competitors on the mat to either side, the referee, even the pools of sweat on the very mat.  He perceived the pulsing of his opponent’s veins, the rhythm of his every breath, the perfect symmetry of his gi patches.  Flawlessly executing a cartwheel pass, though he had never attempted one even in training, the scoreboard read 5 points to 6 as he passed to side control, then 7 to 6 as he transitioned to knee on belly, then 11 to 6, as he took mount.  All his senses kindled as in an inferno, victory was soon his.

The next round was a phantasm, his opponent an apparition.  The lights of the gym, the polyurethane of the mat, all merged in his mind into a single unity.  The purple of his opponents’ belt was the most perfect amethyst within the pleasure dome of Kubla Khan.  Taking any grip and executing any move he desired, he saw invisible jiu jitsu as through a microscope as the spirits of Jigoro Kano, Helio Gracie, Oswaldo Fadda and the fallen warriors of all favelas merged within his soul and the cells of his body.

By the final round, Peyton was fatigued and hungry.  The thought of the podium propelled him forward.  Against a talented opponent, at length he executed a flawless single-leg, which brought him into the familiar waters of a flattening top half-guard.  The very mat hovered in space, and the spectators on either side, figures hooded as if attending a black mass, stood in perfect symmetry and whispered  in strange tongues.  His neck and jaw were in pain.  But his hand was raised.  Victory was his.

Standing triumphant on the podium, all was bright and serene.  His professor, smiling broadly, resplendent in a track suit approaches, a belt as brown as the Brazilian earth in his outstretched arms.  As his own faded violet belt is removed and the royal amber wound about his waist, he feels a violent shaking of his legs.

He had been finished in the quarterfinals.  The referee swung and shook his legs from side to side beneath the bright lights of the gymnasium.",dma202,2023-03-12,Ireland

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of psychedelic drugs for therapeutic purposes. However, what has received less attention is the practice of microdosing, which involves taking very low doses of these substances to improve mental health and well-being and enhance cognitive function. Microdosing has been popularized by online communities such as the subreddit r/microdosing, where users share their experiences and insights about this practice.  
  
To better understand the motivations, dosing practices, and perceived benefits and limitations of microdosing, researchers Toby Lea, Nicole Amada, and Henrik Jungaberle conducted a content analysis of discussions from the r/microdosing forum titled Psychedelic Microdosing: A Subreddit Analysis. Their findings shed light on the reasons why people engage in microdosing, what they hope to achieve, and the challenges they face.

I often dedicate days to drilling sober so I learn the moves efficiently, but try to time my edibles to where the edible is hitting right around time to roll. 

If I had to quantify why I feel it to be essential, I’d say that it’s a combination of relaxation and  far less focus on my own discomfort as it pertains to fatigue and cardiovascular exertion. 

A nice 2g shroom trip makes me peppy and goofy. I bet it would be a great roll but I haven’t gotten so brave yet. Also, mushrooms for me are something I do maybe 6-10 times a year and I try to value and enjoy each trip and try to bring back something positive. Idk if I would feel like I wasted a trip on rolling. Maybe it would be fantastic. Idk

Smoking weed before rolling I don’t like. It’s a bit harsher and headier, feel more fatigued. Some people love it. I also just don’t wanna be the guy who stinks of weed. I smoke in my own time but never prior to training. 

As with so many other things in this sport, to each their own. I wouldn’t have any issue rolling with someone on a light 2g trip.

Abstract

This literature review thoroughly examines the current research on sleep in elite ultrarunners. While the importance of sleep for athletes is well-established, the unique challenges that ultrarunners face regarding sleep have not yet been extensively explored. The review delves into the specific sleep patterns, habits, and disorders of ultrarunners, and the impact of sleep on their performance, as well as exploring strategies for improving sleep in this population. By synthesizing the existing literature, this review underscores the importance of sleep for athlete health and performance, particularly in the context of ultrarunning. It fills an important gap in the current research and provides valuable insights for athletes, coaches, and researchers seeking to optimize athletic performance in the context of sleep.

I don't see how they could actually make this work, if only because it would seem that the strength of a union would be to force the administration/state to the bargaining table over this kind of clause. Or would that just result in the state dissolving the union? It would seem like that would be something that the feds would have to get involved in?

I'm not an expert in union law - I'm not even in a union, but it seems like the basic idea of collective action would be that if someone were fired over bullshit, the union should get involved, and threaten to strike or take other action until the state backs down.

In their supreme naivete, they never imagined these measures could be used against *them*, and now we will have to live with the consequences. To wit:

> 3) Encourage students (or random people completely removed from the institution, much less classroom) to “out” professors for supposed bias.

This is simply cancel culture, but repurposed by the right.

> b. Claim that “anything that may make a student feel shame or other bad feelings, or go against their sincerely held beliefs” is to be “avoided.” 

This is core wokeness. It's the natural evolution of ""words are violence"", trigger warnings, microaggressions, punishing critical discussion of hot-button issues with cancellation, reputational destruction, and so on. Just from the right this time.


> 5) In the new proposed bill, FACULTY hiring is taken out of faculty and even lower admin hands and placed squarely in the hands of again, the politically appointed Boards of Trustees.

Wretched indeed. But did anyone really think there would never be a counter-reaction to the ideological hiring filters we have *now*, with diversity statements being required for most if not all jobs in academia? (If you are now asking yourself how the hell mandatory diversity statements are an ideological filter, you are part of the problem).

> 6) “Faculty should er on the side of caution.” This is the very general and vague guidance – intentionally...

We have this now. Hell, there are a couple posts a day here asking about how to present some idea or another so as not to trigger, traumatize, harm or commit literal violence against out students. And apparently, we will continue to have this, but with a different set of acceptable taboos.

To be clear, I abhor DeSantis and his ilk, and I think the proposed legislation is a goddamned travesty. 

But as an anti-woke leftist, labor organizer and former union local leader, I also see how the woke set the stage for this by abandoning leftist ideals for identity politics, and by selling out vital principles because they feel that they're so firmly on the right side of history that they decided those principles don't apply to *them*.

Now the chickens are coming home to roost, and the right own all the poultry farms. I bemoan this, but I'm sadly confident that the woke will learn absolutely nothing from their catastrophic zealotry and unprincipled behavior.",EpsomHorse,2023-02-27,Ireland

I feel that social platforms like reddit generally just discourage people from voicing non-mainstream(with respect to that community) opinions. It is really easy to create echo chambers. People prefer getting positive reinforcement. 

When you argue with strangers on internet, you dont know their background and motives, people tend to form assumptions based on stereotypes. People often become very defensive. Many countries nowaday seem to have extremely polarised political environment. You are forced to take sides. Your arguments are judged based on your stand rather than their validity.

It is a very small sample size but a few days ago I asked on reddit when was the last time they argued with people on internet and it ends up both sides reaching mutual standing. It seems most people agreed that it is very rare. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/106bugn/when_was_the_last_time_you_had_a_long_debate_with/

I think a good exercise for kids to do is switch-side debates, make them share their arguments afterward, let them nominate+vote for topics they care about. It is also important for them to learn that the goal of a debate isnt just to determine the winner(I would go as far as to say that I learnt the most from arguments I lost).

Another good exercise would be to ask them to identify a piece of news article that spreads misinformation/makes an unfounded claim, and try to disapprove it with data/reputable sources. After you collect these articles, you can use them as material for further exercises(ask other students to identify the misinformation, ask them whether they agree with it).",saintshing,2023-01-13,Ireland

There's also a ton of Facebook groups to join!! For example, Band Directors, Middle School Band Directors, and more. 

Also, a huge proponent of teaching music is finding good repertoire to help develop the skills you are teaching, but also to enrich students culturally, aurally, and musically. For me, the ultimate goal is to create independent musicians. This could be listeners, concert-goers, rock stars, rappers, composers, etc...

You can know how to play most band instruments and the ones you don't know will stick out like a sore thumb.  Fortunately, you can remedy this by taking private lessons in the instruments you don't know.  Start with the core four (flute, clarinet, trumpet, trombone) and grow from there (the fifth-most important instrument for a band conductor to know would either be tuba, alto saxophone, or percussion).

It is fortunate that you already know how to play some of these; you'll want to expand your skills until you know all of these, and just continue adding instruments until you have them all.

b) Study under skilled band directors.  It sounds like you've already done that by playing in university, but if you have the opportunity, ask to observe a college band director and just study what they do, and ask them why they do what they do.  You could also play in a community band provided that they have a good director.",CanadianFalcon,2020-06-22,Ireland

Try to become familiar with as many of them as you can (ideally, the ones you'd come in contact with in your classroom). You don't have to be perfect at them. I like to know basic technique, fingerings, and what students are likely to struggle with for each one and have a ""toolkit"" prepared of ways of helping them through that. Kudos on having a lot of variety in ensemble experiences too.

I'd look into reading about rehearsal technique for running an ensemble; it's structured differently from a typical classroom, so there are some differences in teaching in that kind of a context. I'm sure a lot of does overlap, but since every student and the teacher are usually collaborating all at once, it's a different from a room where the teacher teaches and students listen, or students are doing work on their own. (It's also common for new music teachers to get caught up in explaining and not getting to the ""doing"" part.) Reading about rehearsal tech can also give you tips on how to solve common problems to keep things running smoothly.

Important: idk if your program required all music students to take conducting classes regardless of concentration like mine did, but if not, I HIGHLY recommend learning about that and practicing. Maybe I just have a big head or something, but it was a lot harder for me than I thought it would be, lol. (I knew someone who was hired to teach a conducting class, who had never conducted in their life... trust me, it'll make your life easier and your students will feel more confident in the class.)

I'm assuming he's talking about yard duty/supervision during recess and lunch? 

In the Australian school system a lot of this is the norm. Teachers are expected to (and it's in their contracts) 
- do recess/lunch supervision a couple of times a week 
- participate in clubs/sports (esp in private/independent schools, building the school/home partnership) 
- write cover lessons for when you're absent due to illness 
- pick up cover lessons for other teachers when absent (you usually have empty periods esp in high school when you can be allocated someone else's class if they're away) 
- parent teacher interviews once a semester, sometimes once a term depending on the school (assuming this is what the zoom interviews OOP is referring to). 
- do all the planning OOP mentions. 
Not saying it's ideal... when I was working as a teacher I would have preferred not to do yard duty, but who is supervising their kids if no one is on duty?! And who is taking their class when the teacher is absent... Do those kids just aimlessly float with no direction to learning if the teacher is away?!",Sea-Midnight4762,2023-03-05,Ireland

After almost 25 years in the field, nothing mentioned here surprises me; I’ve seen all of the above first hand. There is good admin and terrible admin. There are bitter, petty, gossiping teachers and teachers who value integrity and professionalism. 
The good news is: changing environments is usually rather easy, so if you don’t like it, leave. 
The bad news is: too many people can’t handle being professional so they resort to childish and absurd “misbehaving”, teachers and admins alike. 

How about we all act like grown-ups?

Education is a business that’s rarely properly funded, so money is always an issue. Folks need to remember it’s about doing the best we can with what we’re given. Someone has to look at the bottom line and work within it. Enter admins.

This isn't cocky, this is confidence! If you love the idea of being a teacher, I say go for it. There will always be a need for teachers. You can make a huge difference in kids' lives. You can also take your passion and creativity with the arts by applying it if not in your profession than at least in a volunteer capacity. There may be some organizations around you that connect kids to the arts, for example. You could even start up your own group. When you get creative people together, anything can happen. If you major in Art along with the teaching degree, you could even go into something like Arts Administration. That's working with people and it's helping the arts succeed in society. Either way I think it sounds like you got a great path ahead of you and you'll definitely find a way to incorporate all these things you love.

Background:
Limited data are available on the long-term consequences of early sports specialization in high-level athletes.

Purpose:
To evaluate the existing literature on the effects of sports specialization among professional, Olympic, and other elite athletes.

Study Design:
Systematic review; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods:
We performed a systematic review of studies from 1990 to 2021 on youth sports specialization in professional, elite, and/or Olympic athletes following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. An elite athlete was defined as one who performed at the highest level of his or her sport, beyond college level. Data were summarized according to 6 objectives: (1) definitions of specialization, age at specialization, and participation in other sports; (2) motivation for specialization; (3) athlete perspectives on specialization; (4) performance data; (5) specialization and injury risk; and (6) career longevity.

Results:
From 8756 articles, 29 studies were included, of which 17 (58.6%) were survey-based studies. Of the 8 articles that commented on injury risk, all demonstrated reduction in injury risk in athletes who delayed specialization. Performance benefits were apparent with later specialization in 7 of 9 articles; the remaining 2 showed benefit with earlier specialization in marathon runners and soccer players. There were less definitive results on career longevity, with 5 of 9 articles finding no association between career longevity and sports specialization.

Conclusion:
Although current data on sports specialization in elite, professional, and Olympic athletes are mostly retrospective and survey-based evidence, most sports demonstrate better performance after youth multisport engagement, and youth sports specialization was linked with increased injury risk in athletes at the highest levels of competition.",Helicase21,2023-03-03,Ireland

The Khmer Rouge executed educated people, others who had ties to the old government or anyone who was believed to be advantaged by the old society (doctors, teachers, soldiers, actors, singers, boxers, etc.). under this regime martial arts were banned at this time and many boxers were executed or worked to death, which nearly caused the death of pradal serey. An estimated 1.7 million Cambodians or 21% of the population died during the Khmer Rouge regime according to the studies of the Cambodia Genocide. not arguing wether or not the claim of Kun Khmer being the original martial art is legitimate or not, but there is definitely history prior to the 2000s. i live in the LA area and i’ve personally met multiple Cambodians who fled the genocide first hand in Long Beach. they lived through literal killing fields, the fact they preserved their culture through those odds is deserving of the upmost respect in my eyes.

I'm Cambodian and practiced Kun Khmer and Muay Thai. Here's a spoiler, its the same fucking thing!!! Both use 8 limbs, same concept on kicking and same rules fighting under Kun Khmer or Muay Thai. Kun khmer is cambodia martial art and its known internationally now. Cambodians should be happy with that and instead of fucking crying over spilled milk on which one was first, they should support their martial art just like of The Thai's government support Muay Thai.  

Khmer people needs to look at the big picture here. They're competing against Muay Thai fighters and sometimes Thai fighters win and sometimes Khmer fighters win. That in itself is huge. If cambodian wants to to be better then they should focus on getting their gym to improve on equipments, trainers, pad holders and etc. I love both muay thai and kun khmer but in my opinion, muay thai is better. They're better because of the rich history they have. Fightera of this era have trainers from Muay Thai  Golden era. I feel like Muay Thai understand the art and science and have better methods on how to win a bout via by points, tactics and etc. If you watch any Kun Khmer fights, a lot just go for the KO and their clinch games is not on par with muay thai. There's so much more to say but it'll take forever. 

Long story short, 

Khmer people stop hating on a legend like Buakaw and just focus on supporting Khmer fighters. ONE Championship did a fantastic job promoting Kun Khmer when khmer fighters fought as well as giving then the chance to get paid because their prize money is down right not enough when they fight in their homeland.

I know an older Asian guy who practiced Muay Thai in Thailand before 2000s up to early 2000s, I believe he stayed a decade or more. He's well versed in the histories of Muay in Thailand and surrounding areas. (Of course before Cambodia and Thailand existed, there were the kingdoms of Siam and Khmer and the political boundaries were hazy then, not like now).  This guy explained to me some history between the kingdoms of Siam and the Khmers after asking him if Muay came from Cambodia or Thailand. The king of Khmer kingdom prevented his people from practicing martial arts as he perceived it to be a threat, and so had the martial arts masters killed. Those Khmer martial arts masters who wanted to hide from the king moved to surrounding areas, within or near Siam (modern Thailand). Some of these masters even served as bodyguards to the king of Siam. The king of Siam supported martial arts to be freely practiced among his people and that's why the martial arts prospered in Thailand.  You know that music that is played in Muay tournaments? That is also the sort of music that Cambodians use, like in funerals. It's Khmer music. The fact is these two kingdoms being neighbors have deeply interwebbed histories. Cambodia's claim that Muay Thai came from Cambodia is not totally unfounded, however I think because Thailand developed it to the modern version apart from the ancient practice, they can also correctly call it Muay Thai. The Cambodians frequently point to their ancient temples with carvings of Muay.... The Khmers are darker brown and the Siamese are lighter brown, (check the Cambodia-Thailand fights and observe that the darker skinned fighter is always the Cambodian).... and it doesn't help that Buakaw is darker brown and looks Cambodian more than Thai. If you can't distinguish then you're not Asian/SouthEast Asian... because Asians can distinguish each others apart LOL... ANYWAY, I am Southeast Asian but not Thai or Cambodian so I am neutral on this issue... I learn Muay from Thailand, however I also feel bad for my Cambodian brothers and sisters who have been ruled by evil men to purge some of their culture. So all this hulabaloo though unfortunate doesn't seem strange to me given its 'history""...whether it's true or not, this is mostly what the Cambodians believe and so from that point of view I can understand their reactions with Muay Thai and Thai fighters (Note: that history is according the the Kru (non Thai and non Cambodian) who told me about it, not my story and not my idea LOL so don't ask me about it..... maybe some other historians can shed light on this matter...some neutral historians...

I mean, technically that’s not wrong since Ayutthaya was a Khmer trading outpost but once the Khmer Empire started falling apart and Ayutthaya grew in wealth and power (due to its status as a port city, eventually growing comparable to Paris and soon became one of the largest metropolitan areas in Asia, if not the world), Ayutthaya started to assert itself more and became its own nation.

product, it needs to be given a specific and clear task to work on. This  
 isn't being done right now. Those I've spoken with say MOD is   
struggling to more clearly define what's needed. The issue stems from   
the lack of specialists in MOD who understand the technical root of the   
issue.

this parallels to what a reddit user a few months ago posted about not being able to create UAVs in Armenia because of the lack of guidelines from the MOD on whats needed. The problem is that to work in the MOD you need years of military experience and unfortunately right now our MOD is mostly filled with soviet generals who stuffed their stomachs instead of the country. as the interviewee said, you also need people who understand drone technology, but education in Armenia has been so poor for decades and scientists have been treated so badly that that 3/4ths of the scientists and inventors left the country. So now we have almost no one with proper military experience and proper understanding of UAV technology to work with the private sector on behalf of the MOD and develop a plan",T0ManyTakenUsernames,2021-08-23,Ireland

Athletics AND PE OR Physical Education OR Teacher OR Sports Science,https://i.redd.it/qnr2kldccdja1.jpg,I am looking to switch into a career in Data Science and have sent my resume to 50+ companies with no luck. I have 2+ years of experience in a similar industry and am not getting any interviews. Is my resume the issue?,"Hey there! I have had a quick look and have included some feedback below. If 10/10 is the full potential that your CV has, I would rate this current version as a good start to work with and a 3/10.

* There are two dates on the right-hand side for your first job. That is not necessary given you list out your different roles beneath.
* I think you mean in your first bullet point that you forecasted ""*changes* in charge volume"" and not ""*charges* in charge volume"" - a typo, especially this early on, does not give the best impression (even more so for data-driven roles where attention to detail is important).
* Your bullet points lack a clear demonstration of impact, and your actions are often ambiguous or unclear. I can see you trying to do this, but it can be executed much better. For example:
   * Your first bullet point could be, “Projected changes in charge volume with 98% accuracy by building a predictive multi-factor model in SQL and Python from first principles.” This makes it instantly clear what impact you had and creates an image of the actions that you actually took. Your current point as it stands has a lot of ambiguity and weakens the impact of the bullet point. If you repeat this for every bullet point so each has a quantifiable result and a clear action that almost anyone can understand you will 10x the strength of the resume.
* Introduce more white space into the resume between sections for better legibility. Currently there is a bit of a ""blob of text"" effect going on.
* You appear to have been promoted in less than a year. If this is the case and especially if it is uncommon I would call it out, put in brackets after your current role ""fast-track promotion"" or ""promoted ahead of schedule"". Progression is impressive and a clear signal to future employers that you get the job done.
* Your freelance tutoring role does not add much value. Save the space for better content or allow for more white space.
* Your skills section can be tightened up by having clear categories for your different skills and a more tangible explanation of how skilled you are in them. For example, you could group them into ""coding"" and ""data modelling"". For your proficiency, you can put how many years of experience you have with each skill-set / tooling or another objective measure of your knowledge.
* Your education section looks relatively empty for someone only 2-3 years out of university. Were you in the leadership of any clubs? Won any impressive awards? Ranked any subjects? You can beef up your technical credentials in this section.
* The leadership section looks a bit strange as a standalone. I would incorporate it into your education section. Then make your skills section ""Skills and interests"" and move it to be the last section. Add some of your interests and make them more exciting than just ""travelling and running"" this is your one spot to show a little a bit of personality.

But, in time, it became so commonplace that soon the shock wore off -- no longer did an ACL surgery to an 8-year-old raise eyebrows, nor did the constant stream of patients so young seem unusual. Five years ago, Pandya estimates that he alone would see about 1,500 pediatric sports injuries and perform maybe 150 surgeries -- ACL, cartilage, shoulder injuries -- in a single year; those numbers have ""skyrocketed,"" he says, and last year stood at 6,000 and 400, respectively. More than half of his operations are now on those under the age of 14.

The athlete today is so focused on the one sport and playing since such a young age, they’re just putting so much strain on their muscles and joints. More so just because of how much they play, year around when in past it was basically just the high school season and maybe some summer camp or something. He also spoke on the strain part, how playing other sports when you’re younger helps you with mobility/etc. In grade school and high school you may have played multiple sports but now it’s so focused. It’s a problem when it’s become so common just for a 18/19yr old to tear an ACL or other major injuries.

Hard work leading to success is a good narrative to promote, and in the long run, societies and individuals that prioritize this bring out their natural talents better than those that don't. But believing you have to work harder just to be able to compete with other people by default is a poison pill that so easily gets mixed in with the other belief. That's why you should always compare yourself to who you were yesterday.

Like the other commenter said, I do think Physical 100 is the perfect antidote for people believing Asians are unable to be athletic. While everyone on the show definitely had to work hard to get the physiques they had, they could still achieve the same heights as anybody else, and can win in fair contests for agility, speed, strength, etc against other races. More importantly, it showcases visually what we had to for years argue verbally, which is always more effective in persuading people. That it's a hundred Asian people with diverse and relatable backgrounds that are in shape just perfect.

In the end, it is the better product for shattering stereotypes than this movie, well-intentioned though it may be, because it shows that normal Asian people can be attractive, fit, good leaders, etc, and that there's more than one way for us to do that.",Irr3sponsibl3,2023-03-01,Ireland

I remember this being a big issue many folks in the Asian community brought up when the NBA would do their commentary on Jeremy Lin exactly like that while they would emphasize 'power' and 'athleticism' for the majority of his fellow black players in the league.

With China coming up on more gold medals for weight lifting as well as improved economy and general health of citizens in different Asian countries, there are more and more potential athletes from those regions who can accomplish just as much if not more than their non-Asian counterparts.

I think with the narrative white people have crafted on placing themselves, black people, and the hispanics/latino people as being the most 'athletic' for different racist reasons ranging from white supremacist beliefs of racial superiority to outright discriminatory stereotypes that 'promote' the image of athleticism with certain 'non-white' races while talking down on their ability to be in positions that white people have created for themselves by stepping over others.

It's a whole mess and the worst part is how those non-Asian minorities join the white people in promoting these ridiculously ignorant beliefs. I suppose the same goes for our community in the sense we are seeing a level of 'whitewashing' of our Asian brothers and sisters who have climbed so high in the economic/social ladder to the point they are outright appeasing white folks (indirectly or directly) because they are so bent on breaking through the bamboo ceiling that we all know continually gets raised by the white folks who want to keep us below while they laugh all the way to the top.

While I'd like to just chalk it up to white supremacy or gweilo bullshit, the whole issue with how our people and race is treated in different democratic or western states is a far more complicated issue that has so many small issues woven into the bigger problem of how we are all treated in general as Asian people. I'm no expert in ethnic studies or political science for that matter but there are many experiences I have gone through and stories I hear from  my fellow Asian brothers and sisters to know that there are a solid chunk of problems with our overall society that cause us to struggle with these problems whenever we are in another country that our parents or ancestors did not originate from.

It can be tough to promote a balance between our native culture/customs along with the culture/customs of the country we are citizens of or living in. Ultimately, this is where the community effort comes in to make sure that stays there (such as Chinese Benevolent Associations or other associations that promote supporting our own Asian communities). As an Asian American, I can say I'm glad we are mostly able to keep many of our customs and traditions alive to some extent despite the constant threat of whitewashing and cultural erasure that comes from the pressure of being more 'American' out here. Yes we are still fighting against those threats to our culture and people but I think even if we are struggling to win out on this issue we are still successful if these efforts continue to survive despite the efforts to shut us down and erase us.

Ultimately, it's a long way to go and I guess learning from our parents or ancestors we must 'endure' as our culture has long told us for thousands of years since our peoples became civilized long before any of these gweilos and other non-Asians did. Our identity/culture has indeed endured and we will continue to endure as we always have since the start. As long as we know our histories and stay informed we will know when it is time to break our calm silence and strike with an effective viciousness that reminds these non-Asian gweilos why we are not to be fucked with or spoken about like that.

Yes...I value how our beautiful culture and customs have made many of us civilized individuals who know better than to act up or abuse others selfishly. However, out here in places like the US, Europe, or even other similarly developed states we need to know when to drop the respect and gentler aspects of our culture when it comes time to stand up for ourselves. When they did the same to us there was no quarter or mercy given, so why should we be expected to do the same when it comes our time to return the favor? It is unfortunate but like many instances in history the civilized must resort to barbaric or vicious methods that their less civilized counterparts have done in order to keep them in line. I never enjoy the idea of having to do so when that does happen but honestly with the way things are going some of us need to be ready to band together and do whatever is necessary to protect ourselves and our way of life.",richsreddit,2023-03-01,Ireland

I have no qualms with the investigator and believe they are doing a good job so far in an institution that can be difficult to work in.

While I have encountered OCR attorneys handling cases that I didn't like, this investigator is *not* one of them. I have had other interactions with them and they seem genuine and ask good questions of me. They also opened a major investigation into a case I care about that isn't politically convenient and that takes courage.

The issues with this case are aligned with broader issues with OCR and how enforcement works. I firmly believe that this OCR investigator is doing what they can for the case given their own restrictions from the agency. It is those restrictions, policies and high level direction at OCR that are the problem. I would not at all be surprised to learn that there are attorneys at OCR that have some of the same gripes I do.

Do not harass any investigator. Especially this one, they are a good one. **Any ire is best felt for the agency itself, your elected representatives that guide policy, and agency leadership that carries it out.** Complaining to or harassing OCR employees does absolutely nothing to help change things, and is likely to even make shit worse. Writing representatives and publicly criticizing OCR policy and high level leadership decisions is the *only* path to getting change we want.

Remember, this is just a case. These are learning tools for me to probe the system and see where change is needed. A success or failure here is immaterial to the goal of the activism here. Filing cases and seeing how they run is a multi year dialogue and exploration of policy that informs my activism.",MRA_TitleIX,2023-02-15,Ireland

For allegation 1:

I think I just don't understand what you're accusing TWUS of. Or more specifically, you seem to be accusing them of being created by discriminatory state law. OCR's position seems to be, if they obey the state law and as a result disobey federal law, then it's in their purview to address the infractions themselves. But if they disobey the state law and obey the federal law, then there's nothing for OCR to do. And that seems sensible to me.

But it also seems to me that your intent was to condemn the entire organisation as a whole. I only vaguely remember some of the Title IX texts and there is something in there about creating a discriminatory environment.  And everything you mention points to that. The mission statement is the most damning. A lot of the other stuff look like separate allegations.

&#x200B;

For allegation 2:

I mean, common sense says that obviously they are discriminating against men for the student regent position.

I don't know much about the OCR process (everything I know is from reading your stuff). But I would assume that they don't expect you to come with full proof in hand when you make an allegation. But at the same time, I assume they need some kind of foundation for you allegations. And I just don't know what the bar, or what they would be looking for.

Here's some thoughts:

>“\[h\]ave a strong desire to represent all university  
students.”

That's absolutely nothing at all. You're practically undermining your own credibility by presenting this as evidence. The only way to read discriminatory intent in there is by claiming that they didn't mean the ""all"" and that the only students they really care about is the women. You've posted a lot of evidence that suggest that this would be true, but the statement itself is no evidence at all.

> The odds of this happening by random chance are less than 10%.

10% is actually REALLY high. That means 10% of the universities under OCR's supervision would have something that looks like this but is actually not discriminatory at all. Add to this the number of situations where this could have happened (e.g. different positions etc..) and pretty much all universities have something happening somewhere that appears discriminatory because it only has a 10% of happening.

However, are you sure you did the math right? How many regents have there been? At 20 regents, it's 10%, at 40 it's 1% and at 60 it's 0.1% (which is when it starts to be seriously suspicious). But that's assuming 10% students being men the whole time.

&#x200B;

So, in general, I feel like I disagree that these were incorrectly refused. But when it comes to bureaucracy the bias can sometimes be hidden in places it would take a bureaucrat to find. For example, it's possible a more friendly system would have actually helped you get it exactly right before they pass judgement on it. It's important to keep fighting, there are bad guys out there. But beware of the windmills, they look menacing, but really they're just standing there.

&#x200B;

>In 1994 they opened all their programs to men. They made no real effort to transition to a school that didn't have a ""one-sex"" admissions policy. 

That's because you weren't around 20 years ago. If you had been, they would have either completely reformed by now or been dissolved. And if they were still around now, the last thing left to do would have been to make them change their name.

Both women and men have a wide range of physical capabilities, and it’s likely that athletic performance is much more complex than hormones and genetics.     
       
I’m confused, are they saying here that cisgender males don’t in general have a significant athletic advantage over cisgender females?   Like, maybe I misunderstand what they meant with that quote, but it seems to fly in the face of essentially all known reality.    
       
Female athletes are often more athletic than male couch potatoes, but with no disabilities and reasonably similar amounts of excel use / training, the male advantage is considerable in the big majority of situations.     
          
Maybe I just don’t understand how they meant that, because that seems a crazy thing to say.

Unfortunately, the discussion has been hijacked by bigots who, realizing this is one of those rare issues where they actually have some sort of scientific basis they can cite to in support of their bigotry, have unreasonably monopolized and distorted the actual underlying issues.

From a scientific perspective, there are of course differences in the bodies of men and women. Differences in strength, bone density, anatomy, hormones, etc. are all present, and may, in different situations, provide an advantage or disadvantage, depending upon the demands of the activity being participated in. Some of these may be corrected for, like hormones. Other potential advantages are not so easy to address.

But of course, the article does not say there is no scientific basis -- it says that the law is not grounded in science, and concedes these differences exist. Success in sport is far more than simply possessing physical advantages. Tennis is a great example, as the top-50 or so men really do not differ much in terms of athletic ability. Mental strength is the real differentiator. Or in the NFL, look at Tom Brady, certainly the most successful QB in history, he has always fallen short of his peers in terms of physical ability, but he wins nonetheless. How? The ineffable comibination of mind and will against provides the necessary competitive advantage.

Any college that he might want to go to he should fill one out for. 10.95 is extremely good for a 16 yr and should improve when he reaches 18.,Track_Black_Nate,2023-03-05,Ireland
Athletics AND PE OR Physical Education OR Teacher OR Sports Science,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sprinting/comments/11incc1/athletics_university_scholarships/,Athletics University Scholarships,"He should start to look into that now yes. The best way to do it is to have your son just look into individual colleges that he is interested in, see if he can find any information online about what times they're looking for people to run, and if it's hard to find or he just wants to be sure then he should email an athletic coordinator or track coach for that school or somebody of that sort. It varies school to school what times they want, but with a 10.95 he can definitely get a scholarship somewhere, especially if he's 16 and still has time to improve it.

I would also let you know that a full scholarship in track and field is very rare, he's more likely to get a partial scholarship, but may also receive other benefits such as free food, books, or housing. Again it depends on the college. He can also get a partial track scholarship and a partial academic or other scholarship that combine to make a full scholarship, if he has good grades or is in other programs that would allow him to do something like that. Encourage him to keep his grades up as well, track isn't everything in life and colleges usually do like for you to have good grades even if youre just there on a sprinting scholarship.

Depending on when that 10.95 was run and what he runs this year it will narrow his options somewhat, a high level D1 school like Oregon will want him to be a bit faster for a scholarship, probably 10.6 at the very least. he can still improve and possibly get there, but he should also pursue other schools and options as well.",--buddhistboy--,2023-03-05,Ireland

Precure, these ideas are great.

Another idea we could have is a team actually composed of international Cures/Cures from different nationalities as exchange students (e.g., the pink Cure is from Japan, then we can have a blue Cure from the Philippines, yellow Cure from India, purple Cure from France, perhaps a red cure from the USA), not just having separate Cure teams per country, then the villains are comical parodies and well-hidden jabs at authoritarians (Pu\*\*n, Tr\*\*p, Ma\*\*\*s (the older one, not the younger), Dut\*\*\*e (idc which one), St\*\*\*n, Muss\*\*\*\*i, Hi\*\*\*r,  Bol\*\*\*\*\*o, KJU, XJP, and many others). 

A less political idea: A team of Cures based off Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligences. It is kinda similar to the academic one, but not quite. The pink would most likely have Interpersonal Intelligence, though I wouldn't mind if it was Naturalistic Intelligence like Tsubomi's, the blue can have any of Linguistic or Logical/Mathematical, the yellow can have Bodily-Kinesthetic or Visual-Spatial, or let's just say the 8 Intelligences are a mix-and-match between the Cures.",No_Sale_3609,2022-12-25,Ireland

But as for themes I'd want to see:

* A comedic-themed season - Like Precure already loves to hang lampshades on a lot of magical girl conventions, so how about a season that is deliberately comedic and a loving parody/homage to itself/the magical girl genre as a whole?
* Phantom thief Precure - There might be some people who wouldn't want the Precure to be thieves, but maybe they could also do a twist where the villains have already won and the Precure are thieves because they need to steal the collectible gimmicks of the season in order to have the power to overthrow the villain group and free the Earth/the universe from their clutches?
* Train themed season - Don't ask how this would work, I just like trains a lot and trains are really popular in Japan so this could possibly be the first Precure season to make one Precurillion yen in sales.
* Circus themed season - This isn't 100% a serious idea I'd like to see one day (although I do think it could work), I just think it'd be funny if they did it because there's a possibility one of them could be called Cure Clown and then I could say 'Look, they made a Precure based off the fandom' for viral clout on Twitter lol

ALSO this isn't a theme for a season or whatever but I genuinely want Toei to give us a Precure who's also a sukeban because that's so cool but I guess I could see Toei not wanting a juvenile delinquent Precure but IDK I feel there's ways they could do it and still have it be OK for the kiddies (maybe they're actually nice and have a heart of gold underneath their seemingly tough juvenile delinquent exterior or something).",AikoHeiwa,2022-12-25,Ireland

An arts program - as I think you are using it - is actually part of the curricula.

Sports are extra-curricular activities. I don't think you are talking about cutting 'Gym' classes.

The next thing you need to do is choose a level and stick with it. The logistics for High School is vastly different than a college/University. 

At the high school level, sports play an important role. This is not only for the students but also the community. They generate revenue that offsets costs (or may even turn a profit). They can help fund facilities that are used both for events as well as classes. Swim teams can use the same pool the gym classes use. Football field has the track and field area gym classes use etc. By having these teams, you can get revenue to offset operating costs.

As yourself now about the arts. What are their net costs? Do you get dual use out of the facilities? Amazingly, the answers here can be yes too. Back in the day when I was in High school, the school had an auditorium and did plays (drama class) as well as symphonies (band) for the community. (or poor guilted parents!) 

When you are a High School administrator/School board, you have to look holistically at the budget. You need to consider what you can fund and what you cannot. You look at the impacts and how many students are involved. The problem is, many sports have significant offsetting revenue which makes them 'cheap' on the budget with significant impact. Certain arts programs - expensive with limited student impact. When something has to be cut, make the smallest student impact by cutting non-core items that cost the most. And remember, this is still non-core items. 

When you jump to the college level, things change dramatically. 

Sports are better described as 'big business'. In many colleges, football or basketball coaches are the highest paid employees but a large margin. The revenues and profits are measured in the millions. Sports also can be recruiting tools for the college. They are donor relations tools. They build name recognition.  There are low name recognition sports as well. Typically, the sports programs are not only self funding but a significant net positive for the university. (scholarships paid, donors paid etc)

Even for a smaller college, depending on how you look at the books, it can still be considered a good investment. 

The arts though are more of a curricula/program question. This is where you ask what the enrollment demands are for a given program. It makes zero sense to fund something that is a loss leader/money sink for the university. If you don't have a good 'specific arts program', you would not invest to create one. Other schools exist.

And all it takes is a little research to find exceptional arts schools for almost any chosen form. Since you get to choose where you want to study, you can try to match your desires to the priorities and programs of a given school.",Full-Professional246,2022-04-07,Ireland

There’s more to winning than just for the sake of it. Moment winning means more money, and also attention on the school which probably functions as advertising.

Preface I hate sports. I'm a teacher and the way my coach coworkers bicker and talk about their students like tools of war disgusts me. I also hate the new culture of holding your kids back to bank on sports scholarships. Oh and the lifelong injury. Also disgusting.

BUT this is not a good enough reason to cut sports funding. To get funding in the first place resources need to get utilized to a certain degree. For example you aren't going to hire a coach for 3 students who want to play golf. If 20 students want to play golf though then it's a no brainer.

Tied with this though is getting and maintaining the broader interest level of the school community and losing and playing for fun doesn't do that. You especially aren't going to convince teens to join sports teams that have a historical losing streak. Then the interest dwindles and the sports die off altogether due to low participation combined with low funding.


Music on the other hand is just equipment and teachers. But the equipment can range from hundreds of dollars for low end stuff to thousands of dollars per individual instrument. For example if you want a single alto-sax that's going to be 4k USED. Then kids break them and the cost starts to not justify the situation. What's more nobody cares about music or art competitions with the ferocity of sports. So there's less of a stigma to join from that perspective. It is more about the skills.",championofobscurity,2022-04-07,Ireland

This admits some bias. If you support keeping art around because it has proven benefits, then you should not support cutting sports just because their benefits have not been sufficiently studied. That is not the same thing as research concluding that they do not have benefits. It's entirely possible sports are very beneficial, and it would certainly make sense that they teach cooperation, communication, competitiveness, and hard work.

> It is a recognized and unsolved problem that student athletes are more prone to bullying than students engaged in other extracurricular activities.

How can you know that sports are actually causing those students to be bullies? It seems logical to me that people who were already aggressive, competitive, and angry would want to play sports, especially contact sports.

> Cutting arts programs without cutting sports is both misogynistic and homophobic.

Just because something affects gay people and girls more, that does not mean it is sexist and homophobic. By this logic cutting sports is racist towards black people since they disproportionately play basketball and football.

Finally, often sports are so well-funded through no fault of the school. Years ago at my high school, the school received a $100,000 donation to replace the grass on the football field with turf and install new stadium lights. That use was a condition of the donation.

Although it may affect LGBTQ populations more percentage wise, that doesn't make it inherently homophobic as it could be very easily coincidental. 

This is the only example I can think of but it's about a controversial topic. The following example doesn't serve to give my opinion on the topic but only as an example of people affected.

Anti-abortion laws affect cis people more than LGBTQ people. Yes it does affect the LGBTQ community, but it disproportionately affects cis people.

I think something you are missing is the degree to which school sports play a central role in their town and in their community (possibly even to the extent that it is Detrimental to the students). Even if a high school team is losing money, it can still be an emotional and cultural touchstone for a community at Large, beyond just the athletes that compete on that team. This is why we are seeing them treated more and more as professional teams, because they are increasing filling that role, of being about the town rather than the school or the students. 

Which is why I opened with the bit about the parents. If the parents themselves derive a lot of value out of watching the team play, they aren't going to cut them, even if they aren't profitable, even if the students may be more injury prone than necessary.

*A lot* of parents *really* like sports.

This isn't the case at every school, and is *probably* less focused-on in urban schools, but you know the stereotype of the small town where the dad can't stop talking about his high school football glory days? And *insists* his kid try to have the same high school career?

That is 100% accurate, for large-- and I can't say this enough-- *large* swaths of parents all across the country.

I don't agree with their focus on sports. But I also can't *change* it, and neither can you. Not just by willing it so.

So what happens when public schools cut sports? Those **large** groups of parents will seek alternative schools-- either the wealthier schools that can afford to still have a sports program, or private schools that rise up to fill in the gap.

This will be *terrible* for public education. Fewer students with fewer programs will create a cycle that just constantly drains the school, until it's running on bare bones resources or is shut down entirely.


Sports are such an intrinsic part of American culture (and it seems your view is focused on America) that there's simply no way around this. Not without several generations of social re-defining of importance, anyway.

I don't *like* it, but it is how it is. Funding schools sports over other programs is not good for students directly-- or at least, not the best option-- but the widespread ramifications of *not* doing it will harm students significantly.

There is *some* hope that [things are changing](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uneven-playing-field-middle-class-and-poor-kids-are-ditching-youth-sports/) but it isn't widespread enough to solve the problem. (and as that article notes, sports *do* come with a *ton* of benefits that decreased funding takes away from poorer students)

>Public speaking, aesthetics, creativity and problem-solving are direct   
benefits of the arts.

These are all useful in a career context, sure. However the assumption that creativity and problem solving are not something learned in sports is just incorrect. Even to me, someone who did not grow up in the USA nor has ever played any team sports myself, can see how cerebral a lot of aspects of it can be. Let's take the main one: American Football. Are you telling me that coming up with, learning, and learning how to dynamically switch between multiple complex strategies / plays under pressure and doing so in coordination with your entire team does not require creativity and problem solving?

In addition, two additional very clear benefits of participating in sports programmes are learning discipline and resilience. Yes, those can also be found in the arts of course. But that is exactly my point, a lot of the benefits of one over the other you are claiming come from your deep bias towards one and superficial understanding of the other.

For sports specifically, they are quite a bit more competition oriented than the arts are in most cases (yes, not all). Learning how to persevere after losing is also useful in careers and in life.

Hell, one could even argue that some sports can teach the value of aesthetics and presentation at the very least in the context of how it can affect others'  behaviour.

In addition, your sources for going from STEM to STEAM don't actually show an increased adoption of the terminology? From the [nature.com](https://nature.com) article:

>It’s an idea that’s catching on: in 2018, the US National Academies of   
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommended that education in these   
subjects include the humanities, arts, crafts and design. In effect, the  
 acronym STEMM (denoting science, technology, engineering, maths and   
medicine) is gaining an A for arts, making it STEAMM 

So they made a recommendation? That's neat. but did it go anywhere? Is there any actual data around potential employers and the market in general valuing arts at the same level as STEM? That's not even going into the fact that it's not an apples to apples comparison, as Arts are part of a curriculum and the other is an extracurricular activity. People don't come out of universities with a Sports degree.

&#x200B;

On your second point, I would like to quickly mention a few things. First, worth acknowledging the very real presence of toxic arts parents too. Second, the transgender bathroom ""debate"" was not exclusive to locker rooms or even educational institutions for that matter. Making it exclusive to sports is disingenuous. Third, debates around which divisions transgender athletes should participate in don't exist purely due to sports based transphobia. Are a lot of arguments in it transphobic? Absolutely, but even if you somehow managed to remove all transphobia from the equation you would still end up with a debate with no easy answers. The fact that sports are physicality based and come with the complexities of judging people on physical prowess does not make sports inherently bad or transphobic. It would be like saying sports are better than performing arts because the latter has issues surrounding the pressures and unrealistic aesthetic standards that come with being judged on looks and presentation, with the former having ""no similar issues"" as you put it.",josemartin2211,2022-04-07,Ireland

2. I read that study and a variety of variables you are not considering. For example, the study was in Lithuania.

Arts programs are a great way to work the mind. However the economic benefit of getting kids out and moving. Cutting back on sports would mean cutting back on [habit](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/poll-many-adults-played-sports-when-young-but-few-still-play/) forming that carries on into adulthood. A habit that lowers [medical costs](https://stop.publichealth.gwu.edu/sites/stop.publichealth.gwu.edu/files/documents/Fast%20Facts%20Cost%20of%20Obesity.pdf) and propensity for obesity even into [adulthood](https://www.scitechnol.com/peer-review/relationship-between-high-school-athletic-participation-and-adult-fitness-and-metabolic-health-LEzj.php?article_id=6394). So while their are certainly benefits to art that go beyond school. Sports teams are a strong majority for adult fitness, and their has been strong connections made between kids playing sports and healthier lifestyles and habits.

Below are a few relevant quotes from the linked sources. It's not an angle you were likely shooting for, but the US has an obesity epidemic and cutting sports fuels it, while cutting arts does not.  


>About half of adults (48%) say they do vigorous- or moderate-intensity exercise on a regular basis. The vast majority of adults who exercise report doing so for health-related reasons (71%), including to improve health, get into or stay in shape, or lose weight. Adults who exercise are more likely to have higher incomes, more education, and tend to be younger than adults who do not exercise.  
When adults who regularly did any vigorous- or moderate-intensity exercise in the past year were asked the type of exercise they did most often, the top five most frequently reported forms of exercise were walking (27% of adults who exercise), cardio/aerobic activities (23%), running or jogging (15%), weight lifting (12%), and biking (6%).  
“Despite the known health benefits of sports and exercise, more than four in ten Americans haven’t done either in the last year,” said Blendon.

&#x200B;

>Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that participation in HS athletics is associated with improved adult lifestyle habits and cardiovascular fitness. Further study is needed to confirm the findings. 

&#x200B;

>Estimates of the medical cost of adult obesity in the United States (U.S.) range from $147 billion to nearly $210 billion per year.

Arts programs don't promote the same things that sports do. With team sports in the USA everything is geared to promote a way of thinking in which it is entirely normal to put on uniforms, participate in some nationalism (The Star Spangled Banner) followed by having two teams of kids acting like two armies. In the case of US football that means bashing the hell out of other people entirely on the basis of them having different uniforms; giving the players lasting health problems as a result. US sport tends to be done in a way that teaches the kids to be compliant soldiers.

And hey... traditionally in the USA it's groups of males doing this, while bouncy young hotties are paraded around as if they are rewards for winning. Hail the conquering hero (with a side order of rather obvious misogyny).

Getting groups of people to cooperate when there's a mismash of goals and attitudes is always a challenge that requires a great deal of effort, and will often result in at least a small amount of strife.

You've gone through many replies already, but I ask that you give my response a thorough read. I hope it can provide an explanation for why schools invest in non-academic events, A.K.A. sports. 

You are right that sports are problematic for universities. The vast majority of schools lose money from their sports teams. [The NCAA published in 2019 that 40 of the 65 division-one football teams lost money on their programs](https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/analysis/2020/11/20/do-college-sports-make-money/). On average, these schools lost $15.9 million. That same year, [254](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/draft/draft-totals.htm) students were drafted into the NFL. That's a pitiful amount. Out of roughly [16,000](https://www.sportskeeda.com/college-football/how-many-ncaa-football-players-make-nfl) student candidates, only a small 254 (1.6%) ever get drafted. This paints a sad picture: schools lose millions on events that have no impact on classroom experience while  failing to secure the overwhelming majority of their athletes careers.

The big question is ""why do schools prioritize sports when its so costly?"" Simple, colleges want to improve their rankings and publicity. [A 2021 paper study found that 1 in 4 of America's top 100 colleges codified in their strategic plans the pursuit of college rankings](https://www.whatwilltheylearn.com/the-problem-with-college-ranking). Key factors for ranking include the amount of students that apply to a school, the amount of alumni who donate, and the recognition of a university by its competitors. Universities leverage the publicity of their sport teams to achieve these goals.

Prioritizing rankings might sound asinine, but it is a huge concern. Ralph Kunci, the former vice provost of John Hopkins said: “The trustees [of John Hopkins] would go bananas” when their school would drop in the ranking. Rankings have a huge impact on a school's reputation and ""funding"". 

[78.5%](https://educationdata.org/college-enrollment-statistics#:~:text=78.5%25%20of%20undergraduates%20attend%20public,time%20equivalent%20(FTE)%20students.) of the undergraduate population attends public universities. Despite these universities mass enrollment, they don't make a lot of money off their student population. Tuition covers [20%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQWlnTyOSig&ab_channel=PolyMatter) of a public school's operating budget, on average. Most students do not pay the sticker price. However, there are special students that always pay full price: international students. These students, completely oblivious about America's non-ivy league schools, rely heavily on ranking magazines to determine which schools to go to. After government funding dried for schools after the 2007-2008 financial crisis, schools began marketing aggressively to international students to compensate for lost revenue. They found that the most effective strategy was to play the ranking game. Schools, by improving their ranking, were able to capture international student revenue and avoid budget deficits.

Arts matter. In a digital world, content of all forms is consumed voraciously and companies are desperate for credentialed artists. Schools should supply the talent needed. However, universities prioritize rankings and sports creates the publicity required to rise. Simply put, art doesn't pay the bills as well as sports.

Sports are featured on TV and create a brand for a school. They inspire alumni to donate. They make halfwit high school students apply for a particular university. Most importantly, sports improve rankings to attract more students (especially international ones). There is no difference between the sports department and the marketing department. Sports pay the bills. That's why schools care.",Crazed_waffle_party,2022-04-07,Ireland

I don’t know if I would be able to find data to compare arts vs. sports, but there is substantial data to support that sports also make people “better in a wide variety of career fields” than non-athletes.” Being a student-athlete at college or high school requires teamwork, communication, taking direction/coachability, self-awareness, rule-following, sharp time management skills, leadership, interpersonal skills, and perseverance. Skills that many non-athletes do not have to hone at school (or at least not to such a degree). Further, the networking that student-athletes have access to because of social relationships related to their sport is unreal. And you cannot discount how much society values the student-athlete, so much that often former athletes mentioning to future employers that they played sports is very attractive, for the skills developed as mentioned, as well as less valuable reasons (glory, etc.)

“The paper finds that former collegiate athletes score higher on measures of mentoring and emotional intelligence and have higher salaries through the first ten years of their careers than their non-athlete counterparts. The paper also finds that there are significant interaction effects for gender, such that male athletes score higher than male non-athletes on measures of mentoring and emotional intelligence, while female athletes score the same as non-athletes on these measures. “
https://doi.org/10.1108/PR-08-2012-0149

“Moreover, team sports athletes as well as male athletes realise significantly higher incomes. Comparing the in- come of former female athletes with male non-athletes, we find that participating in elite sports closes the gender-wage gap.”

This article also compares some specific time-management related skills in sports vs. arts that you might find interesting, though it’s not concretely here or there. “participants interested in sports have higher scores in goal setting and technique and evaluating sub-dimensions and participants interested in fine arts have higher scores in free time attitudes and scheduling sub dimensions.”

Sports programs, especially with todays environment, may be the first and only chance to establish a life time love of physical activity for some kids. What good is a artsy career is you have diabetes, heart disease, and mobility issues, and die at 42 because no one ever taught you that exercise can be fun?

I agree that arts needs funding, but the solution to kids being hamstrung by lack of arts funding is not to hamstring them more by cutting sports too.",destro23,2022-04-07,Ireland

The only critique I would make is that in your section on Judaism, you say that the bondage in Egypt and the wandering didn't happen, and so Judaism formed differently. If these observations are helpful, please use them, and if not, then don't worry about it and keep developing this! 
1. The bondage in Egypt and wandering in the desert already did not happen. There is no historical evidence for a million Hebrews leaving Egypt to conquer Canaan. These stories are probably products of the post-exilic community, based on older stories. 
2. It wasn't ""The Jews"" enslaved in Egypt. It was ""the Hebrews."" Jewish identity was profoundly shaped by the deportations and the diaspora, and by the second temple period.

a counterpoint to tennesse william from an orthodox jewish perspective. 

1. we believe that we were gradually tricked into enslavement and that it was so extreme eventually that the very idea of just leaving didn't occur to us

2. most of that ""wandering"" was just being encamped in one place until the generation that accepted the spies slander of the land died out. seriously, one encampment was around 38 years long iirc

Also there are very few resources on it compared to the other two.

BM is a lot of common sense wrapped up with terms and theory but it can definitely be useful, especially if you have aspirations of being involved in business somehow.

Econ isn’t nearly as math-heavy as some people make it out to be. Whenever a calculation is needed, it’s just fractions, percentages, ratios or otherwise simple arithmetic. No crazy functions or calculus or whatever. I think the stuff you learn is pretty useful, especially if you have even a passing interest in world/domestic affairs and it can be pretty insightful into a lot of the decisions being made by govts, etc.

Personally, econ is the more interesting course but it’s also more demanding than BM. Tho if you’re particularly concerned about your four HLs, it’s probably advisable you pick something that minimises your workload",f1006,2021-06-02,Ireland

STEAM education sounds like it's meant to dumb down STEM education initiatives, there is plenty of art in schooling already, the US is falling behind in STEM though.  Just looks counterproductive from the outside.

No, it's not. The PMC thesis is revisionism and mirrors the lolbert obsession with ""managerialism"". It is a distraction from actual struggle against capitalism by redirecting it into a struggle with capital's middle-management.

Western countries lost their radicalism before the rise of the PMC. Which can be adequately explained by Marx and Engel's observation of the rise of what came to be called the labor aristocracy.

>The individual pmc themselves are not held responsible for a particular decision themself because they work in teams (as opposed to the worker who can be faulted for subpar work or holding up the factory line).

This line is a perfect example of how your post is absolute drivel. In fact it is so counter-factual it makes me doubt you have ever worked in an office or a factory. In the office while there might be a ""team"" most PMC are creating individual works such as reports or presentation. The ""team"" is just the people in a particular role to whom certain types of tasks are assigned. Group projects usually involve 2-3 authors. And those workers are these days usually getting managed individually by KPIs and other systems originally introduced to measure the productivity of factory workers.

While factory worker performance is often assessed individually there are still many examples in the modern day of group punishment for not meeting quotas (as individual assessment takes time and care). If the line is slow management is more likely to just move workers between stations and ""motivate"" with threats. Computerized performance management systems like Amazon's might punish individually but they don't take into consideration issues such as a worker being delayed by other workers.",EngelsDangles,2023-01-01,Ireland

The fuck it is. I, for one, don't see how you can reconcile a Marxist conception of class with the idea that PMC is actually one. The issue with managers being both technically unproductive and socially parasitic/reactionary has been described by Marx without any recourse to a new ""class"". Also, I've no idea what you mean by value as ""behavioural patterns"" and what that has to do with Marx at all.

The PMC today is certainly r-slurred, but they're not the actual capital owners.

This study seems to point to the same mechanism in terms of ""muscle memory"" where by you don't tend to create individual recollections of specific individual actions and their effect but rather simply repeat an entire ""String"" of actions to a known result.

This would also reinforce the idea that if you truly want to ""Learn"" something fully you should not just ""Practice"" but rather Practice DIFFERENTLY every time.

Otherwise you might simply begin to rely on a pattern that may not be universally applicable.",TGE0,2023-02-07,Ireland

But from what I understand, the study says nothing about zipping and unzipping. I don't even know how you could in principle show something like compression before communication between different areas, this is such a weird idea given how little we understand about the brain.

What I think their study actually says is that for sequences, the order of actions and their timing appear to be kept separate. Their findings also suggest, and I suppose this is where the zipping comes from, that the place where these types of information are integrated (during the ""planning"" phase) is not the same as where they are executed. So it could have also been (and has been speculated) that when you mentally prepare an actions that this planning uses more or less the same network as actually executing the action would, it just activates some of the neurons a little less, so that the activation is not enough to trigger the actual movement. And their results suggest this is not quite the case, but that the planning and integration happens elsewhere.",kuchenrolle,2023-02-07,Ireland

From the title, I would assume that “zipping and unzipping” meant that the information starts out being “zipped” and then gets “unzipped” almost like a memory cache or something similar. What the article actually says though is that the information starts out “unzipped,” or stored all over in different brain regions, and only when the activity is performed does the brain “zip,” or assemble all the various pieces of information together to perform a complex task. I also don’t think this is new or novel information about how the brain works, we’ve know the brain works this way for a long time. This is just saying that a study was performed where the subjects learned specific motor skills associated with complex tasks and were then observed with an MRI performing said tasks, and that process confirmed that the brain works as expected for complex motor tasks…",eblingdp,2023-02-07,Ireland

The muscle memory involved with certain routines becomes... just that. There are many jokes and memes and stories about when asked how to perform certain maneuvers or to just walk through them step by step, we can't do it as well.

It's especially clear when you consider what happens throughout the process, assuming a CFOP method:

1. First you identify the pieces of your cross. After years of doing this and thousands of solves, you have a sort of visual memory for certain initial states that you know will readily turn into a cross. If you're lucky, you can solve the cross and one or two 'slots' as well.

2. Then you do F2P, where you finish the other slots, resulting in a cube that looks solved except for the top layer.

3. This is where the real 'zip/unzip' happens. There are roughly 57 legal patterns on the top of a cube in this state. Your mind will literally see the pattern showing on the cube, and use that almost like a key to the stored muscle memory that allows you to proceed.

4. This puts you in the final unsolved state, where the top layer has a single color on top, but the individual cubes may be in the wrong spots. There are another 21 patterns here, that are individually more complex than the previous ones. But again, after practice its like your brain just uses the pattern to unlock the moveset.

I will say that I'm not sure this adequately covers the entire experience, in cubing or beyond. That second stage (F2L) is almost entirely intuitive and based on your ability to read ahead, using entirely different skills. While there are patterns, its not quite the same.

I also would contend that there's likely a difference between the people who are simply learning patterns found by others (like me) versus the actual innovators and leading talents... I'm absolutely sure Valk, Zemdeg, Heise and Fridrich herself think about solving entirely differently than those of use following in their wake.",cantuse,2023-02-07,Ireland

You are playing the piece you have already read ahead and processing what comes next while you are playing.

In fact, you can’t play without that look ahead. You need to strategize ahead of time. 

I play the violin and I’m thinking of how I play the next bar, my finger positions, my bow economy, if I should lift my violin higher, if my thumb is wrapped around the neck or if it’s free for me to get my fingers to go higher, how my phrasing is etc. 

All this is possible because I’ve already processed *what* I need to play. What are my slurs? Is it staccato? Is it forte? Any other notations etc. 

Of course practice helps a lot with this but even then you make a ton of notations in your sheet music. Musicality comes because you are able to read and play music as “sentences” vs. just what’s on the sheet music. 

And if you see experienced musicians you’ll see that in addition to all this, they’re paying attention to the conductor, the concert master etc.",brown_burrito,2023-02-07,Ireland

There have been two academic reviews of musculoskeletal changes in transwomen suppressing testosterone.

**Both conclude that loss of muscle mass and strength is small, and that strength advantage over females is retained.**

The first review is Hilton and Lundberg, 2020, published in Sports Medicine.

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-020-01389-3

And the second review is Harper et al., 2021, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.

https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/15/865

Both of these academic reviews are peer-reviewed and published in high-quality, high-impact sports medicine journals.

**Conclusions:**

*Longitudinal studies examining the effects of testosterone suppression on muscle mass and strength in transgender women consistently show very modest changes, where the loss of lean body mass, muscle area and strength typically amounts to approximately 5% after 12 months of treatment. Thus, the muscular advantage enjoyed by transgender women is only minimally reduced when testosterone is suppressed.*

And

*In transwomen, hormone therapy rapidly reduces Hgb to levels seen in cisgender women. In contrast, hormone therapy decreases strength, LBM and muscle area, yet values remain above that observed in cisgender women, even after 36 months. These findings suggest that strength may be well preserved in transwomen during the first 3 years of hormone therapy.*",Caprylate,2023-02-03,Ireland

- he spends an insane amount of money and time to preserve his body. I think 2015 is one of the more notable things he did. He sacrificed his godly 2014 body to lose weight to lengthen his career , this made him play pretty mediocre that season but seems like it paid off. 

- Perfect height / weight to take advantage of mismatches

- Freak of nature / anomoly. No other NBA player ever came this close to being this good this old with this many miles (maybe Kareem or wilt not sure). This is insane considering this list includes guys like Duncan, Admiral, Malone.",CapturedSoul,2022-12-31,Ireland

New training methods that emphasize longevity/athleticism instead of raw gym numbers. There are programs you can hop on as a layperson that will help you get your first dunk as a 40 year old. This is not an exaggeration.

Being super athletic. Lebron was also arguably the most athletic human on the planet in his prime. If a guy has a 44 inch vertical and loses 8 of those inches to age as he approaches 40, he still has a 36 inch vertical. In other words being more athletic means your decline is better.

He's not short. Short players get taken advantage of defensively already when they are in their prime. As they lose their stamina and speed they have less to cover their defensive shortcomings. Height is a physical tool that doesn't decline.

No major injuries. Lebron hasn't had an injury requiring surgery that would keep him out for a length of time that would cause significant muscle atrophy.

Skill. Lebron is one of the smartest and most skilled players in the league. 

PEDs - to maintain, build, and RECOVER muscles and TENDONS. Pretty much all athletes do these. The tendon point is important here. Tendons recover slower than muscles and are a common source of overuse injury. 

Diet. LeBron has the best in the world working to create all his meals that are optimized for his needs.

Dedication. Lebron lives and breathes his routine which incorporates all of this stuff, every day. 

And generally speaking, his mindset of just going on and playing as he gets older. My guess is that a lot of the athletes a few decades ago simply didn't do enough of the above things in order to keep playing into their 30s. There's a massive mental component to this where you just have tell yourself ""I'm just going to keep going until the wheels fall off"" instead of calling it a day when you aren't top dog. You can even see this reflected in a lot of posts by regular people here talking about ""how they aren't the same"" as they turn 30, but the odds are these people just have no idea how to take care of themselves athletically speaking.",Mundingburrasaurus,2022-12-31,Ireland

Players career extended due advancement in medicine and just players becoming way richer and treated like stars. Even 10 years ago Achilles injury was career ending. Players bodies are way better maintained. 

2. Players also play less and actually are not forced to play with injuries. LeBron started in that era but got older in new one. If he was rookie now he wouldn't get mpg similar to his real early years. And the injury risks is significantly higher when players get to their limit.

3. It may be boring but professional sportsman are professional but not everyone is LeBron/C Ronaldo professional. Harden parties, Jordan gambled, Messi changed diet etc. in the second half of his career (there are stories he ate too much pizza etc. in early years).

If you compare it to old times, especially 80s, where many players touched coke etc, drinking/partying was manly thing to do etc. You'll know why careers now are longer.

And despite media controversy from time to time LeBron is just perfectly maintained professional sportsman. From ""bad"" things he definitely has red wine problem (/s), but that's probably one of the rare niceties which actually can be good for your body in small amounts.

4. His playstyle stopped being that much reliant on stereotypical athletics and more based on his size and crazy high IQ.

IMO we'll have more and more guys playing longer and longer at high level (it's already visible in football ⚽). Professional sports mentality changed even when compared to 90s or early 2000s. Medicine also crazily developed.",idk2612,2022-12-31,Ireland

Follow local health boards. There’s a lot of ways to get your foot in the door, you just have to decide on what works best for you right now.

We sometimes fail to realize how broad public health is. Your background IS relevant. There fields within public health that focus on promoting physical activity for youth or health promotion programs for low income families so check out some community interventions that work with a certain groups and “sell yourself” by leveraging your experience in athletic therapy and sports science.

One is to try and get 3 years of any public health experience (maybe not your dream job), and then sit for the Certified in Public Health (CPH) exam. This would give you a CPH behind your name and may advance your career into more advanced (and higher paying) PH positions. 

Another is to look at Graduate Certificates in Public Health. I did a quick online search and EWU has a CEPH-accredited program that is 16 credit hours (7 months) and costs $4400. You can probably find lots of other options. I think UNE also offers an online certificate.

From the public schools into the streets: Crime, prostitution, and AIDS](https://www.massresistance.org/docs/gen2/13c/Lifeskills-ballroom-report/index.html)

>LifeSkills is focused specifically on cross-dressing boys and young men sexually acting out as females, which they describe using the bizarre term ""trans women."" Like the state-funded approach, their mindset involves ""empowering"" these very troubled young people to continue their behaviors in a way that might ""reduce the risk"" of the life-threatening diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS.

>It is not specifically explained what is meant by the ""unique circumstances"" that transgenders face. But LifeSkills acknowledges that ""sex work"" is a major issue within the ""transgender women's"" community.

>(C) Cope with (not abandon) their destructive situation. But given the dangerous lifestyle these ""trans women"" lead, LifeSkills' most important goal is NOT lifting these tragic young men out of this false, destructive ""identity"" and this horrible existence. Instead, their priorities are transgenders feeling ""empowered"" in their ""transgender"" identities while trying to mitigate the medical risks of disease. They do counsel them about working through their problems of housing, prostitution, drug use, etc., but it's a lower priority and they avoid the overall bigger picture: leaving that lifestyle altogether.

No, its due to discrimination and homlessness as per the [site they quote from](https://web.archive.org/web/20130624084629/http://www.projectlifeskills.org/faq)

>>Empowerment is so important because our community has faced extreme discrimination, violence, stigma, and gross stereotypes even from within LGBT communities and women’s movements.

>>LifeSkills acknowledges the many issues that disproportionately face our trans communities, such as gender-based violence, discrimination, school drop-out, poverty, unstable housing, survival sex, the need for gender affirmation, and challenges accessing culturally competent healthcare, many of which directly or indirectly result from the  social stigma and the realities of being trans today.

>>The LifeSkills curriculum contains specific content regarding the context in which HIV risk takes place for many of us, including securing safe housing and employment, and directly addresses the economic allure of transactional sex work, all of which are day-to-day realities for many of our young trans women and which complicate comprehensive HIV prevention efforts.

>>For example, we know that transactional sex work may help solve more immediate problems in our lives, such as securing food and housing, paying for gender transitioning, and earning extra income that may help our families. Similarly, substance and alcohol use may help us to cope with depression and discrimination, yet both sex work and substance use can place us at risk for HIV or other STIs. We need to talk about it. Know our risk boundaries and limits. Care for ourselves, protect ourselves, and empower ourselves.

>>When people are rejected by every status quo in society, this is the type of culture that inevitably will form. When students and teachers at school made fun of them, it was the beginning of this subculture. When ballroom kids had family that called them “faggots” and “sissies” the foundation to the ballroom scene was made. When they could not hide their sexuality behind the comfort masculinity, it became necessary for them to find a place of acceptance, a haven (No matter how internally detrimental it becomes to each individual).

>In 2004, 75% of Kentucky voters passed a State Constitutional Amendment restricting marriage to one man and one woman. On Thursday, Sept. 3, County Clerk Kim Davis was sent to jail by U.S. District Judge David Bunning because she refuses to issue “gay marriage” licenses, a decision which she says is rooted in her strong Christian faith.

>There are approximately 125 county officials throughout Kentucky who can issue “gay marriage” licenses. But the judge was adamant that every county official must be forced to do it and that religious freedom cannot be allowed, despite the First Amendment. “The idea of natural law superseding this court’s authority would be a dangerous precedent indeed,” he said.

So she uses her religions freedom to [step on the rights of others](https://holybulliesandheadlessmonsters.blogspot.com/2015/09/family-research-councils-tony-perkins.html). Is that ok?

>The Nation article, “What’s Next for the LGBT Movement?”, quotes four high-profile LGBT activists who reveal that “gay marriage” was never their final goal. The LGBT movement will not be stopping to rest, they say. Their plan is to delegitimize and crush all opposition to their agenda everywhere in America – particularly in the churches -- no matter how small.

[Let's see it](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403164014/https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/whats-next-lgbt-movement/) then

>Some of the things the article outlines:

>>“Dis-establish marriage.”  “Gay marriage” was simply a stepping stone. Their actual goal is that there be no formal marriage rules at all. This means group marriages are next, then incestuous marriages, and later even marriages to minors. It would simply be up to the people directly involved to decide.

No:
>>>Second, in American constitutional tradition, marriage has long served to justify protecting the freedom of intimate association. Our rights to be left alone in our reproductive and sexual lives are rooted here. But all sorts of intimate relationships need this protection. Get rid of marriage as the proxy for deserving relationships, and those who are not married—fast becoming the majority—benefit.

>>>Disestablishing marriage wouldn’t mean an end to marriage. Au contraire! It would help marriage and by extension all who gain from its special—moral—powers. The state is, or should be, a legal, not an ethical authority. When it serves as the controlling authority in marriage, with its awkward hold on the ethical side of the institution, actually threatens to undermine the institution’s moral sway. Get the state out of the business, and let couples (and groups, for that matter) marry under the auspices of what are for them real ethical authorities. In these hands—of their church, their family, their urban tribe, their garden club—the power of the status to transform would be invigorated. Imagine state-sanctioned bar mitzvahs. Oy!

>>>Does the argument for abolishing marriage imply that the state should get out of our intimate lives altogether? No. Leaving marriage to civil society is no different from leaving the control of baptism to the church. In neither case do we assume that the state thereby withdraws from its role in protecting the vulnerable and promoting equality. What we do assume is that the best way to secure liberty and equality in a diverse society is for the state to be concerned with regulating action, not expression or thought. And when it does step in, it should be only to the extent necessary to protect other citizens from harm, or to guarantee a reasonably fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of social cooperation.

Incest and pedophila fit that. 

>>>So let’s get rid of marriage and create an intimate union status expressly tailored to protecting intimate care in its various forms. This would shift the focus of public discussion from interminable disagreement about the definition of marriage to questions about the importance, nature and distribution of intimate care. Exposing the real costs and benefits of caregiving would increase the likelihood that our policies would address the real needs of all families. Disparate levels of support for civil union and same sex marriage suggest that when we disentangle support for families from marriage we have an easier time doing the right thing by our fellow citizens. 

>Pass strong LGBT “non-discrimination” laws across the US. These are the laws that force bakers to bake “gay marriage” cakes or face huge punishments. Such laws would also force schools to include LGBT indoctrination. Most states still do not have the onerous laws the LGBT movement demands. The activists refer to those states (mostly in the South and Midwest) as “zones without rights” in their propaganda.

Define indoctrination....

>>Ban all “religious liberty” laws. They consider religious liberty to be a dangerous ploy to “undermine all civil rights laws” that must be stopped at all costs. All people must be forced to follow the LGBT agenda, with no exceptions.

You mean not discriminate.

>>Demonize pro-family conservatives and silence all dissent. They plan to direct “massive amounts of funds” to “expose and defeat the right wing” across America.

>The effect: Large numbers of people have lost their bearings on these issues. People who do stand up will “rationally” debate the meaning of marriage or how children need two parents, but will not talk at all about the horrific moral, medical, and psychological issues with homosexuality. Similarly, they will politely expound on “men in ladies’ bathrooms” and “religious freedom” but will not talk about the lunacy of “transgenderism.” In both cases the battle is relatively quiet and orderly, and the Left ultimately wins.

>Another example is the latest wave of “health” and “sex-ed” programs in schools, with extreme explicit and pornographic sexual, homosexual, transgender themes being presented to children as young as elementary school age by public school officials.

Again you lie about it: https://holybulliesandheadlessmonsters.blogspot.com/2009/06/new-obama-appointment-makes-religious.html

>The effect: Most parents who find out are in a state of denial, and simply don’t want to think about it. Parents who are willing to face school committees usually politely complain about “inappropriate material” and “parental rights” instead of screaming about the horrific psychological and emotional rape that’s being perpetrated on children’s minds. (Their bodies are often victimized later, after they’ve absorbed the lesson that LGBT “sex” is normal and healthy.)

>A further example: The Obama administration effectively homosexualized the entire American military that way. (They have even ordered the full participation of ""transgender"" personnell.) The stories that have been coming out are dreadful. Yet, the entire Republican Congress (as well as virtually all of the conservative media) have been afraid to say a single word about it.

>As we reported back in February 2020, Rob Hoogland of Surrey, British Columbia is living that horror story. The courts there have ruled that his 14-year-old daughter, who believes she is “transgender” (thanks to school propaganda), **can be given medical procedures to “change” her sex to a boy** – despite her father’s fierce objections.

>These procedures include puberty-blockers, opposite-sex hormones, likely followed by surgical procedures. According to the “gender clinic” hospital’s own [consent form](https://www.massresistance.org/docs/gen4/21a/Rob-Hoogland-facing-jail/docs/BC-Childrens-Hospital-Consent-Form.pdf) (which the father refused to sign), these drugs are experimental and will cause sterility and other dangerous side effects, such as unhealthy bone growth. The effects are irreversible. But the judges and other government officials are ignoring [those dangers.](https://acpeds.org/position-statements/gender-dysphoria-in-children)

Except they are [proven to](https://genderanalysis.net/2022/02/just-out-study-of-trans-adolescents-confirms-puberty-blockers-and-hrt-are-associated-with-improved-mental-health/) [be safe](https://growinguptransgender.com/2020/06/10/puberty-blockers-overview-of-the-research/)

>Moreover, the court has ordered that **Rob may not discuss publicly any details about what is happening to his daughter.** In addition, the court has ordered that he may not refer to his daughter by her actual female name; he must refer to her as “Quinn” and as “he/him.”

>Section 2 enforces the teachers’ requirement to accept as truth the range of absurd, unscientific quackery that makes up today’s LGBT ideology. Also, keep in mind that until the homosexual movement terrorized the medical societies into changing their definitions, there was no such thing as “LGBT people” in medical terminology. Rather, they were considered to be heterosexual people with homosexual (or transgender) disorders.

[Terrorized](https://web.archive.org/web/20130514051003/http://www.ralliance.org/TVC_APA.html)? 

>Section 3 goes further in coercing the ridiculous concept of “preferred gender pronouns” along with “preferred names.” Adopting these twisted language conventions has resulted in horrible and tragic mental health consequences for vulnerable middle school children, and has led to at least one federal lawsuit by parents. The idea that following these procedures actually “protects” children is preposterous. And it distracts teachers from the job they should be focused on: actually teaching. Note the reference in questions 4 and 5 to enforcement by the school administration.

How come most children [aren't harmed by affirming their gender identity](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-the-science-on-gender-affirming-care-for-transgender-kids-really-shows/).

What irks me most is that they are opening yet ANOTHER university, polytechnic university in Tampa. A university that will probably become yet another public diploma mill, like Florida Gulf Coast or West Florida, instead of preserving the well established department that UF has.

We almost always minor or are forced to study in other areas. In the educational environment we don't just exist to do research. Often times we are assisting and automating important processes in other areas of science. A computer scientist's ability to understand and logically destroy mind boggling problems while being able to relate to the people they are aiding and working with is his most important skill. I never thought I would ever say anything positive about UF after having been an LSU Tiger. As a former operator in nuclear engineering on submarines, as a current comp sci student in Boston and a former SEC school attendee, I sincerely hope that this decision is reversed for the betterment of ...gasp... gator nation. There is no reason to destroy an interdisciplinary department which is one of the few sciences that are contributing to what little  innovation and economic growth is occurring in this country.
